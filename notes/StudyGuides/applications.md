# Examples of Applications of the Discrete Math topics taught in CS29a Fall25

Why should a computer scientist learn discrete math? What is it good for?
Here are some examples.

     - Propositiona Logic is used to define logic gates in CPUs, and to define theoretical complexity of functions, and is used in conditional expressions in programming languages
     - Predicate Calculus is the language of mathematics and proof. It is used to precisely define what a program or algorithm does. There is considerable interest in developing systems that can automatically prove that an algorithm meets a particular formal logic specification. LLM-AIs might be able to help us do this.
     - Set and Functions: these are the fundamental building blocks of Discrete Mathematics
     - Proof Techniques: now that LLMs are able to generate code it is more important than ever that developers can prove that the programs they are writing with help from an AI are correct. This includes the algorithms they use and the general structure of the program. A Proof is a strongly convincing argument that a mathematical statement is true. So we need to express the correctness properties in Mathematics and the prove they are correct.
     - Combinatorics: this is the Science of counting the sizes of sets defined by specific properties. It plays a key role in many correctness proofs as well as in developing algorithms that are efficient as well as correct.
     - Sequences: the goal here is to define a sequence of numbers by some kind of recursive rule and then find a simple mathematical expression for the nth element of that sequence. One important examples is calculating the runtime of a program in terms of the size $n$ of its input
     - Probability: some of the most effective programs are only efficient in the average case, we need to understand probability to determine the averate case execution time of a program
     - Graph Theory: one of the key abstractions in Computer Science is the notion of a data structure and most data structures can be thought of as Mathematical graphs, we will see graphs everywhere in this course -- as parse trees, proof trees, probability diagrams, sets of trees, etc.
     - Number Theory: most of modern cryptography is based on properties of integer arithmetic, we will learn how the Public Key SSL systems work
