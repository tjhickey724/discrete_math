# Strategies for success in CS29a Spr25
* Skills
  * there are [38 Discrete Math skills](../skills/README.md) in CS29a Spr25 +
  * in-class participation is another skill equal to the percentage of answers completed with a Good Faith Effort
  * homework is another skill equal to the percentage of answers completed with a good faith effort
  * that gives a total of 40 skills, so each skill is worth 2.5 points
* Grading - we will grade on the following curve, but may relax the requirements toward the end of the semester.
    * A+ needs 39 skills
    * A  needs 37 skills
    * A- needs 36 skills
    * B+ needs 35 skills
    * B  needs 33 skills
    * B- needs 32 skills
    * C+ needs 31 skills
    * C  needs 29 skills
    * C- needs 28 skills
    * D+ needs 27 skills
    * D  needs 25 skills
    * D- needs 24 skills
    * E  23 or fewer skills
* Strategy for success
    * pick a grade you want to shoot for,
    * determine how many skills you need to master
    * look at the [Skill Study Guides](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/skills/README.md) for the skills you want to master and to the problems, look at the answers, look over the textbook readings,
    * ask an AI-LLM to explain concepts you don't understand and then reread the tutorials/readings to see if it makes more sense
    * look at the old exams and answers section of the moodle site to practice the older problems and check your answers with the answer sheets
    * come to the office hours to get help on concepts you don't fully understand and to get more sample problems to work on
