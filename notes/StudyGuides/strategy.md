    * look at the [Skill Study Guides](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/skills/README.md) for the skills you want to master and to the problems, look at the answers
    * look at the [old exams and answers](https://moodle.brandeis.edu/mod/folder/view.php?id=154297) to practice the older problems and check your answers with the answer sheets
