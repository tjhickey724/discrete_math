# Truth Tree Performance
We know that the Truth Table method can take $2^n$ steps to determine if a formula with $n$ propositions is a tautology.
We first show that in some cases the Truth Tree method can solve very large problems with many propositions quickly.

For example, consider the following:

$A_1$

$A_1 \rightarrow A_2$

$A_2 \rightarrow A_3$

$A_3 \rightarrow A_4$

$\ldots$

$A_{999} \rightarrow A_{1000}$

_________

$A_{1000}$

With the Truth Table method this would take at least $2^{1000}$ steps which is about $10^{300}$ and hence
is impossible.... (how long would it take if you could check one trillion rows per second?) 

But with the Truth Tree Method we see that the tree has a simple form and can be processed in about $1000$ steps.
Likewise, the more general problem with $n$ premises and $n$ propositional symbols could be done in $n$ steps instead of $2^n$.

Note however, that if we instead chose to use the OR-rule on the even implications $A_{2n}\rightarrow A_{2n+1}$ first, and then the odd implications
$A_{2n+1}\rightarrow A_{2n+2}$
we would
get a tree with an exponential number of branches, so the order really does matter ...
