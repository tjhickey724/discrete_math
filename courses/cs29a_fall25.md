# Week 1

## Lesson 1
### Fri 8/29/2023  <br> _Intro and overview_
This week we will give an overview of the course and start our first major topic
which is Propositional Logic and Boolean Algebra. 

Logic pervades all parts of computer
science from the boolean expressions in conditionals and loops, to proofs of the correctness
and efficiency of algorithms. This first week we will focus on the Propositional Logic which deals
with simple statements containing propositions that can be true or false. In the following two weeks
we will expand to first order logic that is the formal language of Mathematics. Every other section
of this course will rely on your ability to work with, and understand the meaning of, logical formulas.

* We begin with
  - an overview of the course by reviewing the syllabus
  - a discussion of why Math might be useful in CS, and what kinds of math would be most useful. Here are
    [some examples](../notes/StudyGuides/applications.md)
  - we go over some [strategies for success in CS29a Spr25](../notes/StudyGuides/strategy.md)
* We ask everyone to connect to the [Mastery Learning App](https://masterylearningapp.onrender.com), if you have registered for the course you will see the CS29a appear on the MLA when you log in with your Brandeis ID.
* We look at the [Skill Study Guides on github](../skills/README.md). Each lesson will cover one or more skills and each skill has a study guide with a description of the skill, some sample problems, a tutorial with additional reading, and the solutions to the sample problems. Today we'll start with three skills which we will continue to cover next week 
* We introduce Boolean Algebra and the Propositional Calculus  
  - We introduce the boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR, ONLYIF in this
    [overview of Propositional Logic](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/overview.md)
* We show how to [create a truth table](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTables.md)
  for a formula, this shows its value for all possible interpretations of its variables.
* and we see [a few more examples of truth tables](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTablePractice.md)
* We get some practice in [converting between English and the Propositional Calculus](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalTranslation.md)

#### Today's skills:

[F01](../skills/Propositional_Calculus/F01.md) Propositional Logic: Syntax and Semantics

# Week 2
### Tue 9/2/25, Fri 9/5/25




## Lesson 2 
### Tue 9/2 <br> _Propositional Calculus and Boolean Algebra_

* Next we show how to find the value of a propositional formula for particular values of its variables
  To do this we need to [create a parse tree for a formula, and then use that tree to evaluate the formula](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalcParseTree.md)
* We show how to [estimate how long it would take to prove a formula is a tautology with the Truth Method](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/ComplexityOfSat.md)
* We review the [inference rules for Propositional Logic](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/InferenceRules.md) from
  [Chapter 3.4 of MfCS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_session4/)
and we show that every formula can be reduced to
  [Disjunctive Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form)
  and also to
  [Conjunctive Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form)

### Today's skills
* [F01](../skills/Propositional_Calculus/F01.md) Propositional Logic: Syntax and Semantics
* [F02](../skills/Propositional_Calculus/F02.md) Propositional Logic: Truth Tables and Satisfiability
* [F03](../skills/Propositional_Calculus/F03.md) Propositional Logic: Translation to/from English

## Lesson 3 
### Fri 9/5/25 <br> _Inference_
* We practice [simplifying formulas](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/SimplifyingFormulas.md) in general and  [simplifying negated formulas](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/SimplifyingNegations.md)  in particular.
* We show how to convert any propositional formula in a [normal form CNF or DNF](../notes/propositional_calculus/normalForms.md)
* We give an introduction to [arguments, formal proofs, and counterexamples](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/SymbolicProofs.md)

# Week 3
### 9/9, 9/12
#### Motivation
This week we learn a graphical method for proving theorems in Propositional Logic.
Next week we'll show how to do this for First Order Logic.

### Homework03
#### due (Tue) 9/16 before class



Connect to the MLA Homework site and do all of the Week 3 problems

## Lesson 4 
### Tue 9/9 <br> _The Truth Tree Method for Propositional Logic_
* We give example of using the [Truth Tree method](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTreeMethod.md) to prove Theorems and to find counter-examples and we describe the steps of the Truth Tree method and explain why they work
* We give examples showing that [Truth Trees can be very efficient, or very inefficient!](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTreePerformance.md)
* We work through [examples combining translation to English with Truth Trees](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TranslateAndInfer.md)
* We also try to prove or disprove validity of inference from the exercises in
[chapter  3 of "The Logic Notes" by John Slaney](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/LogicNotes/exercises2.html)
* More exercises in [Chapter 9 of Part 1 of the Logic Primer by Paul Teller](https://tellerprimer.sf.ucdavis.edu/logic-primer-files)
