# Week 1
### 1/14,17/25
#### Motivation
This week we will give an overview of the course and start our first major topic
which is Propositional Logic and Boolean Algebra. 

Logic pervades all parts of computer
science from the boolean expressions in conditionals and loops, to proofs of the correctness
and efficiency of algorithms. This first week we will focus on the Propositional Logic which deals
with simple statements containing propositions that can be true or false. In the following two weeks
we will expand to first order logic that is the formal language of Mathematics. Every other section
of this course will rely on your ability to work with, and understand the meaning of, logical formulas.

### Homework01
#### due Tuesday 1/21/25 
Read the following sections of two online books on Discrete Math
* DM-AOI Ch 0.2 http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-statements.html
* DM-AOI Ch 3.1 http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_propositional.html
* MfCS [Ch3.1-3.5](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_session4/)
and try some of the problems at the end of the sections. We will go over some of them in class.

Then answer the Week 1 problems on the MLA Homework site

## Lesson 1
### Tue 1/14/2023  <br> _Intro and overview_

* We begin with
  - an overview of the course and
  - a discussion of why Math might be useful in CS, and what kinds of math would be most useful
* We ask everyone to connect to the [Mastery Learning App](https://masterylearningapp.onrender.com), if you have registered for the course you will see the CS29a appear on the MLA when you log in with your Brandeis ID.
* We introduce Boolean Algebra and the Propositional Calculus  
  - We introduce the boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR, ONLYIF in this
    [overview of Propositional Logic](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/overview.md)
* We show how to [create a truth table](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTables.md)
  for a formula, this shows its value for all possible interpretations of its variables.
* and we see [a few more examples of truth tables](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTablePractice.md)
* We get some practice in [converting between English and the Propositional Calculus](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalTranslation.md)


## Lesson 2 
### Fri 1/17 <br> _Propositional Calculus and Boolean Algebra_

* Next we show how to find the value of a propositional formula for particular values of its variables
  To do this we need to [create a parse tree for a formula, and then use that tree to evaluate the formula](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalcParseTree.md)
* We show how to [estimate how long it would take to prove a formula is a tautology with the Truth Method](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/ComplexityOfSat.md)
* We review the [inference rules for Propositional Logic](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/InferenceRules.md) from
  [Chapter 3.4 of MfCS](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_session4/)
and we show that every formula can be reduced to
  [Disjunctive Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form)
  and also to
  [Conjunctive Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form)
