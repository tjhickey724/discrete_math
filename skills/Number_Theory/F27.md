In this section we cover some elementary number theory which will be useful in understanding  
the RSA Public Key Cryptography algorithms.



## The Division Algorithm
One very important feature of the integers is the division algorithm which states that
for any integers m and n with $n\gt 0$ there are unique integers $q$ and $r$ with $0\le r \lt n$ such that
* $m = qn+r$

In Python we calculate these with ```//``` for division and ```%``` for remainder
```
q = m//n
r = m%n
```
For example, with $m=84$ and $n=16$ we get $m = qn+r$ with $q=5$ and $r=4$:

$84 = 5*16 + 4$ 

i.e. $80 \div 16 = 5$ with a remainder of 4

Here, the quotient $q$ is 84```//```16 = 5 and the remainder $r$ is 84```%```16 = 4.


## Euclid's Algorithm
First we introduce Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two positive integer m and n.

The greatest common divisor d of m and n is the largest integer which divides both m and n, that is
$m = m_1 d$ and $n=n_1 d$ and $m_1$ and $n_1$ have no common divisors larger than 1.

The idea is to assume $m>n$ and then divide $m$ by $n$ to get a quotient $q$ and remainder $r$.

$$ m = q * n + r\ \ 0\le r < n$$

It is not hard to see that if $d$ divides $m$ and $n$, then it also divides $r$ which is smaller than $n$
and vice versa, if $d$ divides $r$ and $n$, then it divides $m$.  This shows that

$$\gcd(m,n) = \gcd(n,r)$$

So we continue with the same approach to find the GCD of $n$ and $r$, and observe that the remainders are non-negative and get smaller with each iteration. Eventually, we will get $r=0$ so $m = q*n$
which case $q$ is the greatest common divisor.    This is Euclid's algorithm for finding the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers.

Let's try it:

```
  gcd(80,16)  -- 80 = 5*16 + 4,
= gcd(16,4)   -- 16 = 4*4  + 0
= 4
```
or here is another example
```
  gcd(105,77) --  105 = 1*77 + 28
= gcd(77,28)  --   77 = 2*28 + 21
= gcd(28,21)  --   28 = 1*21 + 7
= gcd(21,7)   --   21 = 3*7  + 0
= 7
```

The following Python program calculates the gcd:

``` python
def gcd(a,b):
    ''' returns the greatest common divisor of a and b
    '''
    if b==0:
        return a
    else:
        c = a%b
        d = gcd(b,c)
        return d
```

Try it out by finding the gcd of 
* 21 and 15 or
* 105 and 49


## Bézout's identity
By modifying the algorithm slightly we can show that if d is the gcd of m and n, then there are integers a and b
such that

$a m + b n = d$

This is known as Bézout's identity.

We can calculate $a$ and $b$ using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, in which we first
find the gcd $d$ of $m$ and $n$ and then use our calculations to find $a$ and $b$. Here is an example
with $m=105$ and $n=77$ and we right an equation for the remainder on the right side for each line:

```
105 = 1*77 + 28       so 28 = 105 - 1*77
 77 = 2*28 + 21       so 21 =  77 - 2*28
 28 = 1*21 +  7       so  7 =  28 - 1*21
 21 = 3*7  +  0
```
now we work backwards using the equations on the right hand side to express the gcd, 7, in terms of 105 and 77:
```
7 = 28 - 1*21
  = 28 - 1*(77 - 2*28) = 3*28 - 1*77
  = -1*77 + 3*(105-1*77) = -4*77 + 3*105
  = 3*105 - 4*77 = 315 - 308 = 7
```
so $a=3$ and $b=-4$.

Here is the code with the proof of its correctness embedded as comments.
``` python
def gcd(a,b):
    ''' returns tuple (d,m,n)
        where gcd(a,b)=d and
        d = m*a+n*b
    '''
    if b==0:
        return (a,1,0)
    else:
        c = a%b
        (d,m1,n1) = gcd(b,c)
        # by induction we know that
        # m1*b + n1*c = d
        # and by definition of // and %
        # a = (a//b)*b+ c
        # so c = a - (a//b)*b
        # so m1*b + n1*a -n1*(a//b)*b = d
        # so m = n1 n=m1-n1*(a//b)
        return (d,n1,m1-n1*(a//b))
```

Try it out by finding the coeficients a and b for the gcds of 
* 21 and 15 or
* 105 and 49

## The Ring $F_n$ of Integers mod n 
Let $n>1$ be an integer and let $F_n = \\{0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\\}$
This is the quotient set for the equivalence relation defined by

$x\equiv y \mod n$ if and only if $n \vert (x-y)$, 

i.e. $x = y+kn$ for some integer $k$.

We can define addition and multiplication on this set by
* $(x * y)$ % n
* $(x + y)$ % n

where $u$ % $v$ is the result of dividing u by v and taking the remainder. 

For example

$4 * 5 = 6 \mod 7$  because $4 * 5=20$ and the remainder of 20 divided by 7 is 6.

$4 + 5 = 2 \mod 7$ because $4+5=9$ and the remainder of 9 divided by 7 is 2.

It is not hard to prove that addition and multipication satisfy the standard properties:
* additive identity:  $x+0=x$
* multiplicative $x*1=x$
* additive commutativity: $x+y=y+x$
* multiplicative commutativity $x * y=y * x$
* additive associativity: $x+(y+z)=(x+y)+z$
* multiplicative associativity: $x * (y * z) = (x * y) * z$
* distributivity: $x * (y+z)=x * y+x * z$
* additive inverse: $\forall x \exists y \ x+y = 0$


## The Finite Field $F_p$ for primes p
If $p$ is a prime the ring $F_p$ has one additional and very important property
* multiplicative inverse: $\forall x\  x\ne 0 \rightarrow \exists y\ x*y=1$

This follows from Bézout's Theorem because if $x\ne 0$ then gcd(x,p)=1 so there exists a,b with
* $ax + bp = 1$

which means that $a*x= 1$ modulo p.

These properties make $\mathbb{F}_p$ into a mathematical object called a Field.
Other fields are the rational numbers and the real numbers and the complex numbers.
which makes it into a "field" and it means in particular that if $x*y=0 \mod p$ then
$x=0$ or $y=0$ mod p.

Because $F_n$ has the properties listed above, we can apply the usual rules of algebra
in this finite field.


## Fermat's Little Theorem

**Theorem** Let $p$ be a prime and $x$ an integer not divisible by $p$, then
* $p$ divides $x^p - x$
* i.e. $x^{p-1} = 1$ mod $p$

**Proof**
First we prove that $(p-1)! = -1$ mod p

To do this observe that each non-zero element $x$ of $\mathbb{F}_p$ has a unique inverse $x^{-1}$
and that $x \ne x^{-1}$ unless x is 1 or -1. To see this, note that
* $x = x^{-1}$ implies $x * x = x * x^{-1} = 1$ so $x^2 = 1$ so $x^2-1 = (x-1)(x+1) = 0$
* so $x-1=0$ or $x+1=0$
* so $x = 1$ or $x=-1$

So $(p-1)! = 1 * 2 * \ldots * (p-2) * (p-1)$ 

and 
all of the numbers except the first and the last can be paired with their inverse. So multiplying them
gives $1$ and we conclude that
* $(p-1)! = 1 * 2 * \ldots * (p-2) * (p-1) = 1 * (p-1) = -1$ mod p

Now suppose we multiply each of those factors in $(p-1)!$ by some $x$ with $1\le x \lt p$, then we get
* $(1 * x) * (2 * x) * \dots * (p-1) * x = (p-1)! x^{p-1}$

but it is not hard to see that
* $((1 * x),(2 * x),  \dots , (p-1) * x)$ is a permutation of $(1,2,...,p-1)$

Indeed if $a * x = b * x \mod p$ then since $F_p$ is a field, $x$ has a multiplicative inverse $y$ with $xy=1\mod p$,
so $a = a * 1 = a * x * y = b * x * y = b * 1 = b \mod p$ so $x\mapsto a * x$ is an injection from $F_p$ to itself and hence is a bijection.

and hence has the same product! so
* $(1 * x) * (2 * x) * \dots * (p-1) * x = (p-1)! x^{p-1} = (p-1)! = -1$

and so we can conclude that 
* $x^{p-1} = 1$ mod p, so
* $x^p = x$ mod p, that is
* $p$ divides $x^p - x$

***QED***

Let's try it out with $p=5$ or $p=7$ and various $x$.

# Fast probabalistic test for primality
We can use Fermat's little theorem to quickly test if a number is "probably" prime.
I won't prove it here, but if $p$ is not prime then 
* the probability that $x^p=x$ mod p is less than 1/2

Actually there are some non-primes (called Carmichael numbers) that satisify Fermat's Little Theorem,
RSA still works with Carmichael primes but it is 
[somewhat less secure:](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BFb0024472.pdf)

So one way to test if a number $p$ is prime is to repeatedly generated random numbers $x$
and test to see if $p$ divides $x^p-x$. If it ever fails, then you know $p$ is not prime.
If it doesn't fail after $N$ attempts, then the probability that $p$ is not prime is less than $1/2^N$.
Picking $N=100$, the probability is less than $10^{-30}$.

# Fast exponentiation
But how can we raise an number $x$ to such a large power mod p quickly?

Below is an algorithm for doing this:
``` python
def power(x,n,m):
    ''' return x^n mod m
        We introduce a variable p, initially 1
        with the invariant on (p,x,n,m) that (p*x^n)%m is constant
        at the top of the loop. When n=0 we return p%m which
        is equal to (x^n)%m
    '''
    p=1
    while n>0:
        # invariant on (p,x,n,m) is p* x^n mod m at top of the loop
        if n%2==0:
            #p*x^n= p*x^(2r)=p*(x^2)*r
            x = (x*x)%m
            n = n//2
        else:
            # p*x^n = p*x^(2r+1) = (p*x)*(x^2)^r
            p = (p*x)%m
            x = (x*x)%m
            n = (n-1)//2
    
    return p
```
## Loop Invariants and Correctness Proofs
Next we show that the "power" function defined above is correct using the "loop invariant" technique.
This is the most common way to prove that algorithms containing loops are correct. The idea is to find some
function which is true before the loop, and whose value isn't changed by the body of the loop, and hence
it must also be true at the end of the loop.

**Proposition** The "power" algorithm above correctly computes $x^n$ % $m$ in at most $\log_2(n)$ steps.

**Proof**
We will show that the value $v(p,x,n) = (p * x^n)$ % $m$ is a loop invariant at the top of the loop. That means
this formula 
* $v(p,x,n) = p * x^n$ % $m$

always has the same value. The first time through the loop $p=1$ and so $v(1,x,n)$ has
the value $x^n$ % $m$ that we want to compute.  After the loop is over, $n=0$ and so
* $v(p,x,n) = p * x^0 = p$

and since the value of v is invariant, $p$ will have the value $x^n$ % $m$ after the loop is over.

There are three cases, and we omit the "% $m$" to keep the notation simpler.
* $n=0$, in this case the loop is over and $v(p,x,n)=p*x^0 = p$ which is the value we return
* if $n$ is even, then $n = 2k$ for some k, and so $v(p,x,n) = p * x^{2k} = p * (x^2)^k = p * (x^2)^{n/2} = v(p,x^2,n/2)$
* if $n$ is odd, then $n = 2k+1$ for some k, and so $v(p,x,n) = p * x^{2k+1} = p * x * (x^2)^k = v(p*x,x^2,(n-1)/2)

This shows that the value of v(p,x,n) is the same at the top of the loop as at the bottom and hence it is the same
before the loop and after the loop, so $p has the value $x^n$ % $m$  when the function returns.

Notice that each time $n$ is reduced by at least a factor of 2, so if there are $j$ iterations of the loop
then n must be at least $2^j$, so  $n \ge 2^j$ so $j\le \log_2(n)$

**QED**

We can also raise $x$ to a power mod $m$ using a recursive function as follows:
``` python
def powerfn(t,x,n,m):
    ''' returns t * x^n mod m
    '''
    if (n==0):
        return t
    else:
        if n%2==0:
            return powerfn(t,(x*x)%m,n//2)
        else:
            return powerfn(t*x,(x*x)%m,(n-1)//2)
```
To prove the correctness of this function we have to show it terminates in at most $\log_2(n)$ calls, which is easy
because $n$ is reduced by at least $2$ in each call and never gets below 1. We also need to show that
the value $t * x^n$ % $m$ is preserved by the function and that proof is the same as the one for the iterative power function above.


## Primality Testing

We can now use this power function to test primality and to generate large primes efficiently as follows
``` python
def prime_test(p,n):
    ''' return true p passes prime test n times '''
    for i in range(n):
        x = randint(2,p-1)
        if power(x,p-1,p)!=1:
            return False
    return True

def generate_prime(d):
    ''' return next probable prime with d digits '''
    n = randint(10**d,10**(d+1)) # generate a random number with d+1 decimal digits
    while not prime_test(n,100):
        n=n+1
    return n
```


## Efficiency of arithmetic on large numbers
One thing we didn't talk about was how much time it takes to do arithmetic on very large numbers.
The simple way is to use the algorithms we use by hand for multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division
and you can convince your self that these operations on two $k$ digit numbers can be done in at most $c k^2$ steps
for some small constant $c$, but since $k$ is a relatively small number (say 100 or 500 or 1000). This doesn't
create a problem for efficient implementation (as you can see by running the Python code!) If we do arithmetic on
numbers with billions of digits, more sophisticated techniques would be needed...


# Answers

## Problem 1
Find the greatest common divisor d for 123 and 51 and then find integers $a$ and $b$ such that
$123a + 51b = d$

***Answer:***
First we compute the GCD
```
123 = 2*51 + 21  so 21 = 123 - 2*51
 51 = 2*21 +  9  so 9 = 51 - 2*21
 21 = 2*9  +  3  so 3 = 21 - 2*9
  9 = 3*3  +  0, so gcd(123,51)=3
```
then we work backwards with the identities on the right hand side:
```
3 = 21 - 2*9 = 21 - 2*(51-2*21)
  = 5*21 - 2*51 = 5*(123-2*51) - 2*51
  = 5*123 -12*51 = 615 - 612 = 3
```

## Problem 2
Show that if $a,b,c,d,n$ are integers and $n>1$ then

***Answer:***
$a = c \mod n$ and $b=d\mod n$ means there are integers j and k with

$a =c + nj$ and $b= d+nk$,so

$a+b = c+nj + d+nk = c+d + n(j+k)$ so $a+b = c+d \mod n$

$a*b = (c+nj) * (d+nk) = cd + cnk +njd + n^jk = cd + n * (ck + jd + njk)$ so $ab = cd \mod n$

***QED***

$a = c \mod n$ and $b=d\mod n$ implies
* $a+b=c+d\mod n$
* $a * b = c * d\mod n$
