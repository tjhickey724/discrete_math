# Tutorial
## Public Key Cryptography
In this note we give an overview of the core ideas and techniques in the RSA approach to public key cryptograpy.

You can see a complete treatment of RSA in Chapter 8.11 of 
[Mathematics for Computer Science by Lehman, Leighton, and Meyer](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/pages/readings/)


The idea is to generate two keys: a public key $k_1$ and a private key $k_2$ and an encryption algorithm $E(k,m)$
which encrypts a message $m$ using the key $k$. The amazing feature of this algorithm is that if you encrypt $m$ with $k_1$ and then encrypt it again with $k_2$, you get your original message back! Moreover, we believe it is
very hard to discover the private key $k_2$ from the public key $k_1$.

## The RSA Algorithm
Here is the RSA algorithm. It is, as far as we know, an unbreakable code, of the primes $p$ and $q$ are large enough
and not too close together.

You create the keys and the encoding/decoding algorithms as follows:
* generate two large primes $p$ and $q$ (typically 2-300 digits long)
* calculate $n=pq$ and $m=(p-1)(q-1)$
* pick a large "random" number $e$ with $0<e<m$ which is relatively prime to $m$, i.e. $\gcd(e,m)=1$
* calculate the inverse $f$ of $e$ mod $m$, that is $0<f<m$ and $e*f=1 \mod m$
* The public key is $k_1 = (n,e)$ and the private key is $k_2 = (n,f)$

Once you have the public and private keys you can use them to encode/decode numbers
and by converting text into binary numbers, you can encode/decode text (or any digital media!)
as follows:
* To encode a number $x$ with $0<x<n$ you calculate $E(k_1,x) = x^e \mod n$
* To decode a number $y$ with $0<y<n$ you calculate $E(k_2,y) = y^f \mod n$
* To encode a text message, convert it into a long binary number (using unicode),
  then break that into a sequence of binary numbers whose values are each less than $n$
  and encode each of those numbers using E.
* To decode a text message given as a sequence of numbers, decode each number, convert it to binary,
  append all the binary numbers together, and convert that to text (using unicode). 

On this page we give an overview and talk about a simple Python implementation of RSA.

We will also [prove its correctness](correctness.md)

## RSA in Python
The file [rsademo.py](rsademo.py) contains an implementation of the RSA algorithm which will let you create a public/private key pair and encode and decode messages using that keypair. We will begin by having everyone
load that file into a Python intepreter (a nice online choice is [brython](https://brython.info/tests/editor.html?lang=en)

We'll spend most of the class showing how to use RSA to have a secret conversation on a public channel and how
to sign digital documents so the user knows it is from you!

RSA was created by [Rivest, Shimon, and Adelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RSA_(cryptosystem)&oldid=1186888624 in 1977. It was the first public-key cryptosystem and though there are many more (e.g. elliptic curve cryptosystems), it is the simplest.

## Using RSA to establish a secure connection when a third party can observe all of the communication
Assume we have three players Alice, Bob, and Carl and that Alice and Bob want to have a secret conversation,
but that Bob can hear everything they say.

* Alice and Bob each create their own public/private key pairs $a_1,a_2$ for Alice and $b_1,b_2$ for Bob.
* Alice and Bob exchange their public keys $a_1$ and $b_1$ and Carl can also see the public keys
* Alice then encodes her private message $m_1$ with Bob's private key and sends it to Bob. Carl sees the encoded message, but can't decode it as Carl doesn't have Bob's private key.
* Bob gets the message from Alice encoded with his public key and decodes it with his private key.
* Bob can likewise encode a message $m_2$ using Alice's public key and send it to Alice. Carl sees the encoded message, but can't decode it without the private key.
* Alice gets the message and decodes it with her private key.

## Digital Signatures
One feature of RSA is that it allows a user to digitally sign a document to validate that they were the author.
Suppose Alice wants to digitally sign a document D.  Then Alice encrypts it with her private key to get D' and
anyone with Alice's public key can decrypt it to get the original document D.  Since Alice is the only one with
the private key, we can conclude that it must have been encrypted by Alice.   This becomes an "unforgeable" signature!



## Proving the Correctness of RSA
We can now see how to generate two large primes $p$ and $q$ and form 
* their product $n=pq$, and
* the product $m=(p-1) * (q-1)$
  
which is the first step in the RSA algorithm.

The next step is to prove that Fermat's Little Theorem also holds for $m=pq$,
that is

**Theorem** Let p,q be two primes and m=(p-1)(q-1) and let $x$ be an integer in the range [0,m-1]
which has no common factors with m, that is $gcd(x,m)=1$, then
* $x^m = 1$ mod $n$

**Proof**
First observe that 
* $x^m = (x^{p-1})^{q-1}$

Let 
* $x_p = x^{p-1}$ and $x_q = x^{q-1}$
 
By Fermat's little theorem we know that 
* $x_p^{q-1} = 1$ mod $q$ since $x_p$ is relatively prime to q, so
* $x_p^{q-1} = 1 + qm_1$ for some integer $m_1$

Likeise 
* $x_q^{p-1} = 1$ mod $p$ since $x_q$ is relatively prime to p, so
* $x_q^{p-1} = 1+ p m_2$ for some integer m_2

So $x^{(p-1)(q-1)} = x_p^{q-1} = x_q^{p-1} = 1 + q m_1 = 1 + p m_2$

This means
* $qm_1 = p m_2$ and since $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, p divides $m_1$ so $m_1 = p m_3$ for some integer $m_3$
* so $q m_1 = q p m_3 = p m_2$ so $m_2 = q m_3$
* Thus $x^{(p-1)(q-1)} = x_p^{q-1} = x_q^{p-1} = 1 + q p m_3$, so
* $x^{(p-1)(q-1)} = 1$ mod $pq$ whenever x is not divisible by $p$ or $q$, so
* $x^m = 1$ mod $n$

**QED**

We can now complete the proof of the correctness of the RSA algorithm.

Pick a random number $e$ in the range [0,m) for which $gcd(e,m) = 1$.
One may need to generate several random numbers to find one which is relatively prime to $m$

Now use the BÃ©zout algorithm to find a numbers $f$ and $g$ such that
* $f * e + g * m = 1$

This means that $f * e = 1 + g * m = 1$ mod $m$.

**Corollary** [Correctness of RSA]
Let $x$ be any integer in the range $[0,n)$ which is not divisible by p or q, and let
* $y = x^e$ % $n$

then $y$ is in the range $[0,n)$ and $gcd(y,m)=1$
* $y^f$ % $n = x$

**Proof**
This is a simple calculation
* $y^f = (x^e)^f = x^{ef} = x^{1 + mg} = x^1 * x^{mg}$ mod $n$
* now we know that $x^m=1$ mod n, so
* $y^f = x * (x^m)^g = x * 1^g = x * 1 = x$ mod n
* so $y^f$ % $n = x$

**QED**

# Answers

## Problem 1
Pick two small primes p,q, and let $n=pq$ and then generate the a public and private key (n,e) and (n,f)
and give some examples of encoding a decoding an integer in the range (1,n).

***Answer:***
Let's pick $p=5$ and $q=7$ and $n=pq=35$ so $m=(p-1)(q-1) = 4*6=24$ and let's pick $e=11$ which is relatively prime to 24.
We now need to find the multiplicative inverse $f$ of 11 mod 24
```
24 = 2*11 + 2 so 2 = 24 - 2*11
11 = 5*2 + 1, so 1 = 11 - 5*2
 2 = 2*1 + 0, so gcd(24,11)=1
```
working backwards we get
```
1 = 11 - 5*2 = 11 - 5*(24 - 2*11) = 11*11 - 5*24
```
so $11$ is its own inverse mod 24 as $11^2 = 121 = 1 + 24*5 = 1 \mod 24$

So in our case the public and private keys are the same (not such a good idea, but only happens with small numbers!)

Let's test it by encoding and decoding the number 2
* encoding 2 ... raise it to the 11th power mod 35: $2^{11} \mod 35 = 18$ 
   * as $2^{11}$ = 2048 = 58 * 35 + 18. So 2 encodes to 18
* decoding 18 ... raise it to the 11th power mode 35: $18^{11} \mod 35 = 2$
   * as $18^{11}$ = 64268410079232 = 1836240287978 * 35 + 2
Clearly I wouldn't expect you to do these numerical calculations on an exam without a computer....
