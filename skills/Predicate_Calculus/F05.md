# Skill Description

Ability to understand the basic syntax and semantics of first order logic. In particular, to be able to * draw a parse tree of a first order sentence or show it is not syntactically correct * evaluate the truth or falsity of a first order sentence for a specific model of the language and either give a counterexample or explain why it is true

# Sample Problems

Translate the following mathematical statements into the predicate calculus

1. for any two real numbers they are either equal or one is bigger than the other
2. there is a real number which is bigger than all other real numbers  (this is a statement but it isn't true!)
3. $x^2$ is less than x if and only if x is less than 1 (this is true for the domain of positive real numbers)
4. for any two positive numbers a,b   $ab \le \frac{a+b}{2}^2$

Now lets consider statements where the domain is the functions from the real numbers to the real numbers, where 
* $I(f)$ means f is always Increasing, i.e. $\forall x \forall y (x\lt y) \rightarrow f(x)\lt f(y)$
* $B(f,g)$  means f(x) is always bigger than or equal to g(x) (i.e $\forall x f(x)\lt g(x)$)
* $S(f,g,h)$ means $\forall x f(x)+g(x) = h(x)$, i.e. f+g=h, so the sum of f and g is h.
* $E(f,g)$ means f and g are the same function (i.e. $\forall x f(x)=g(x)$, they are Equal)

Convert these to predicate calculus using only the predicate symbols I,B,S,E, the quantifiers, and logical connectives.
5. every function f is always increasing or there is a bigger function which is always increasing
6. if f is always increasing the so is 2f (i.e. f+f)
7. if f and g are always increasing then so is f+g
8. there does not exist a function f which is bigger than all increasing functions
9. there is a function g such that f+g=f for all functions f
10. if f is bigger than or equal to g and vice versa, then f is equal to g

# Tutorial

We will introduce the predicate calculus and we practice converting English statements into the Predicate Calculus.

We expand the language of Propositional calculus to include 

* predicates, which are boolean functions of one or more variables, P(x), Q(x,y,z). u=v, u<v
* boolean operators connecting formulas: P and Q, P xor Q, P or Q, not P, P implies Q, P iff Q,
* variables, usually written as letters from the end of the alphabet, u,v,w,x,y,z ...
* quantifiers,where F is a predicate formula
  * $\exists x . F$
  * $\forall x . F$
* functions and constants, e.g.
  e.g. square(x),  x*y, 0, 1, etc.

  
The Predicate Calculus is the language of Mathematics. In theory, anything that can be expressed in Mathematics can be expressed in this formalized language. A key skill is to be able to translate a statement in English into the Predicate Calculus. It will usually remove most of the ambiguity in the original English statement.  

For the Propositional Calculus, the propositions could be thought of as boolean variables which are either true or false, and a propositional formula was a boolean expression as we see in Python, Java, and all other modern imperative programming languages.

For the Predicate Calculus, the predicates are boolean functions over some domain D which we will usually specify ahead of time (e.g. the domain of integers, or real numbers, or strings of characters, or functions on the real numbers, etc.).  Some predicates we write in "infix" mode such as the comparison functions (=, <, >=, etc.). The Predicate calculus also allows functions from the domain D to itself, and constants (which are elements of the domain). This is a very expressive language and most people believe that any mathematical concept can be expressed in the Predicate Calculus.

Our goal is to help you begin to develop the skill of translating English statements to the Predicate Calculus and to assess your mastery using a quiz. If we have time, we'll also start to talk about formal methods for proving theorems in the propositional and predicate calculus, but we'll probably have to wait until next week for that.

## First Order Languages
A first order language $L$ consists of 
* a set of predicate symbols (P,Q,R,=,< >=, ...),
* a set of function and constant symbols, (f,g,h, a,b,c, 0,1,2, $\pi$, $e$, $\infty$, ...)
* a set of variables symbols (u,v,w,x,y,z...)
* a set of logical connectives: $\wedge, \vee, \neg, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow, \oplus$

For the propositional calculus, the language consists just of proposition symbols and
logical connectives $\wedge, \vee, \neg, \rightarrow, \leftrightarrow, \oplus$
The predicate calculus adds predicate symbols, function symbols, constant symbols, variables, and constants!

## Interpretations and Models in a first order language
An interpretation of a first order language gives all of the symbols a particular meaning
which can be used to express properties of some specific domain $D$ which is the
situation we are interested in... The Models of Predicate Calculus are like the "interpretations"
of the Propositional Calculus, they give a particular meaning the formulas which can then be
evaluated to be either true or false.

Thus an interpretation consists of
* a domain $D$ (e.g. the real numbers, or the positive integers, or the set of digits 0,...,9, etc.)
together with an interpretation for the predicate, function, and constant symbols on that domain, i.e.
* each predicate symbol corresponds to some boolean function on the domain $D$
* each constant symbol corresponds to an element of the domain
* each function symbols corresponds to a function on the domain

An interpretation is a **model for a set of formulas** in the predicate calculus if it makes all of the formulas true.

The set of formulas which are true for a particular model is called the **Theory of that model**.

For example, we can talk about all of the formulas which are true for integer arithmetic as the Theory of Integer Arithmetic.




## Translating Mathematics statements in to the Predicate Calculus
Here are some examples over the domain of integers.

### A.  d is a divisor of n  
$\exists k . n = d*k$

### B.  p is prime
(i.e. the only positive divisors of p are 1 and itself)

$\forall p . {\rm prime}(p) \leftrightarrow (p>0) \wedge \neg \exists a \exists b  ((1 \lt a) \wedge (a\lt p) \wedge (p = a*b))$

or, if d is a positive divisor of p then d=1 or d=p

$\forall p . {\rm prime}(p) \leftrightarrow (p>0)\wedge \forall d (\exists a . a>0 \wedge p=ad) \rightarrow (d=1) \vee (d=p)$



and here are some for the domain of real numbers

### C. The quadratic formula over the domain C of complex numbers

$\forall a \forall b \forall c \exists d . (d^2=(b^2 -4ac)) \wedge \forall x ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \rightarrow x = \frac{-b + d}{2a} \vee  x = \frac{-b - d}{2a}$


where the implies could be replaced with an iff

### D. every two real numbers has a number between them
$\forall x \forall y  ( (x \lt y) \rightarrow \exists z  (x \lt z \wedge z \lt y)  )$

# Answers

Translate the following mathematical statements into the predicate calculus

1. for any two real numbers they are either equal or one is bigger than the other

**Answer:**  $\forall x \forall y \  (x=y) \vee (x>y) \vee (y>x)$

2. there is a real number which is bigger than all other real numbers  (this is a statement but it isn't true!)

**Answer:** $\exists x \forall y \ x>y$

3. $x^2$ is less than x if and only if x is less than 1 (this is true for the domain of positive real numbers)

**Answer:**  $\forall x \ (x^2<1) \leftrightarrow (x<1)$

4. for any two positive numbers $a$ and $b$, their product is less than or equal to the square of their average.

**Answer:**  $\forall a \forall b \ ab \le \frac{a+b}{2}^2$


Now lets consider statements where the domain is the functions from the real numbers to the real numbers, where 
* $I(f)$ means f is always Increasing, i.e. $\forall x \forall y (x\lt y) \rightarrow f(x)\lt f(y)$
* $B(f,g)$  means f(x) is always bigger than or equal to g(x) (i.e $\forall x f(x)\ge g(x)$)
* $S(f,g,h)$ means $\forall x f(x)+g(x) = h(x)$, i.e. f+g=h, so the sum of f and g is h.
* $E(f,g)$ means f and g are the same function (i.e. $\forall x f(x)=g(x)$, they are Equal)

Convert these to predicate calculus using only the predicate symbols I,B,S,E, the quantifiers, and logical connectives.

5. every function f is always increasing or there is a bigger function which is always increasing

**Answer:** $\forall f \left (  I(f) \vee  ( \exists g\  B(g,f) \wedge I(g) ) \right )$

6. if f is always increasing the so is 2f (i.e. f+f)

**Answer:** $\forall f ( I(f) \rightarrow \exists g S(f,f,g) \wedge I(g) )$

7. if f and g are always increasing then so is f+g

**Answer:** $\forall f \forall g (I(f) \wedge I(g) \rightarrow (\exists h S(f,g,h) \wedge I(h))$

8. there does not exist a function f which is bigger than all increasing functions

**Answer:** $\neg \exists f ( \forall g B(f,g))$

9. there is a function g such that f+g=f for all functions f

**Answer:** $\exists g \forall f \exists h S(f,g,h) \wedge E(f,h)$

10. if f is bigger than or equal to g and vice versa, then f is equal to g

**Answer:** $\forall f \forall g (B(f,g) \wedge B(g,f)) \rightarrow E(f,g)$
