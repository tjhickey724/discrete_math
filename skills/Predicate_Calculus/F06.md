# Skill Description

The ability to translate English statements about a particular model into First Order Logic, and vice versa.


---

# Sample Problems

Consider the domain $D$ of some group of people (perhaps students at a college)
and the following predicates on that domain:
* S(x) == x is sick with covid
* F(x) == x has a fever
* C(x,y) == x is a close contact of y
* R(x,y) == x and y are roommates
* V(x) == x had the covid vaccine
* I(x) == x has influenza

Translate the following statements into logic.
1. Everyone that has covid has a close contact with covid.
2. If someone has a roommate with covide and they don't have covide then they are vaccinated.
3. If everyone is vaccinated then noone has covid.
4. If someone has covid then all of their close contacts who are not vaccinated have covid.

Translate the following formulas in plain English (where a and b are constants, i.e. refer to
individuals like "Andy" and "Bohan" for "a" and "b"

5. $\forall x . F(x) \wedge V(x) \rightarrow I(x)$
6. $S(a) \wedge R(a,b) \wedge \neg V(b) \wedge F(b)$
7. $\forall x \exists y . C(x,y)$
8. $\exists y \forall x . C(x,y)$
9. $\forall x \forall y . C(x,y) \rightarrow C(y,x)$

# Tutorial

Let's look at how to translate statements in English to the Predicate Calculus
and vice versa.  English is a very ambiguous language, which is nice when you are looking
for multiple interpretations of a poem, but this ambiguity can make it challenging to translate
between English and Logic ... we'll look at some examples in this tutorial.

Consider the domain $D$ of some group of people (perhaps students at a college)
and the following predicates on that domain:
* S(x) == x is sick with covid
* F(x) == x has a fever
* C(x,y) == x is a close contact of y
* R(x,y) == x and y are roommates
* V(x) == x had the covid vaccine
* I(x) == x has influenza

Let's translate the following formulas to predicate calculus

1. Everyone that has a fever either has covid or influenza or both.
   
**Answer:**   $\forall x F(x) \rightarrow S(x) \vee I(x)$
   
2. Whenever people are roommates,  they are also close contacts.

**Answer:**   $\forall x \forall y . R(x,y) \rightarrow C(x,y)$
   
3. Some people are close contacts but aren't roommates.

**Answer:**    $\exists a \exists b . C(a,b) \wedge \neg R(a,b)$
