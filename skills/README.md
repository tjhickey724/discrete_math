### Propositional Logic: Syntax and Semantics 
Ability to evaluate a propositional formula given a True/False interpretation for the propositions in the formula. This also requires the ability to recognize whether a formula is syntactically correct and to be able to draw a parse tree for an expression and evaluate the truth value at every node. We assume that the grammar uses the standard logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR both in English and in traditional Mathematical notation. 


## F02
### Propositional Logic: Truth Tables and Satisfiability 
Ability to determine if a Propositional formula is a tautology, or is satisfiable, or is unsatisfiable by creating a Truth Table with a column for each variable and operator in the formula.

## F03

Ability to translate English statements into Propositional Formulas and to translate Propositional formulas into plain English.

## F04
### Propositional Logic: Boolean Algebra 
The ability to apply the rules of boolean algebra to transform propositional formulas into equivalent formulas. In particular, to be able to * convert a formula to Conjunctive Normal Form or Disjunctive Normal Form * move all negations down to the propositional symbols * convert a formula so it only uses and, or, and not.

### Predicate Calculus: Syntax and Semantics 
Ability to understand the basic syntax and semantics of first order logic. In particular, to be able to * draw a parse tree of a first order sentence or show it is not syntactically correct * evaluate the truth or falsity of a first order sentence for a specific model of the language and either give a counterexample or explain why it is true
