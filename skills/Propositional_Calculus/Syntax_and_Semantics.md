# Syntax and Semantics of Propositional Calculus

## Skill specification
Ability to evaluate a propositional formula given a True/False interpretation for the propositions in the formula. This also requires the ability to recognize whether a formula is syntactically correct and to be able to draw a parse tree for an expression and evaluate the truth value at every node. We assume that the grammar uses the standard logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR both in English and in traditional Mathematical notation.
