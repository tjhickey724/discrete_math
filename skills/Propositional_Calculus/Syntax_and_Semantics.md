# Skill Description
## Skill specification
Ability to evaluate a propositional formula given a True/False interpretation for the propositions in the formula. This also requires the ability to recognize whether a formula is syntactically correct and to be able to draw a parse tree for an expression and evaluate the truth value at every node. We assume that the grammar uses the standard logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR both in English and in traditional Mathematical notation.

# Sample Problems
We test your mastery of this skill by asking you to determine if a formula is syntactically correct, and if so to draw its parse tree and use the parse tree to evaluate the formula on a particular interpretation of the propositions.
