# Sample Problems


## Problem 1
Assume we have a program P with two functions F1 and F2 that are operating either with a high load or a low load. 

We will assume the following propositions are either true or false:
```
E1: function 1 throws an error
E2: function 2 throws an error
H: the load is high
C: the program crashes
```
You will translate English statements to propositional logic using only the logical connectives 
```
   NOT, AND, XOR, OR, IMPLIES, and IFF
```
and the four propositions above (E1,E2,H,C)
* The program crashes if two conditions hold: (1) the load is high and (2) one (or both) of the functions throws an error.
* Two things are true: (1) If the load is high the function 1 throws an error, and (2) if the load is low then the program crashes only if function 2 throws an error
* The program keeps running (i.e. doesn't crash) only if both functions work correctly (i.e. neither function throws an error)
* If the load is low, then the program crashes only if both functions throw an error
* The program crashes if and only if function 1 throws an error when the load is high and function 2 throws an error when the load is low
* If the program crashes then exactly one of the two functions throws an error

With E1, E2, H, and C as above, translate the following propositional logic formulas to English.
* $E1 \vee E2 \rightarrow C$
* $\neg H \rightarrow \neg C$
* $(E1 \rightarrow H) \wedge (E2 \rightarrow C)$

## Problem 2
Suppose we have the following Propositions;<br>
S = the shift key is pressed<br>
X = the X key is pressed<br>
E = the form is in edit mode<br>
A = an alert box pops up<br>

Translate the following statements to Propositional Logic using only the propositions S, X, E, A and the following logical connectives: 
  not, and, xor, or, implies, iff. 

* the shift key and the X key are both pressed
* if X is pressed and it is not in edit mode then an alert pops up
* the alert box pops up only if the shift key is pressed
* if the form is not in edit mode and the X key is pressed, then an alert pops up
* the alert box pops up when an X is typed if and only if the form is not in edit mode
* Either the shift key is pressed or the x key is pressed, but not both
* the form is in edit mode only if the shift key and the X key are pressed
* if the alert box pops up when the X key is pressed, then the form is not in edit mode

and translate the following formulas to English
* $\neg E \wedge \neg A$
* $A \rightarrow E \wedge X\wedge S$

# Practice Converting English into Propositional Calculus

Converting between English and Propositional Calculus can be challenging because of the degree to which
English is an ambiguous language. Once you have specified the propositions, logical formula involving those
symbols are completely unambiguous, but the conversion of such a formula to English, or the translation from
English in the Propositional Calculus is more of an art than a science. In this tutorial we will just go over an example
and then give you several problems to practice on...

## Propositions for the problems
Let E1, E2, H, and C be as in Problem 1 above...
```
E1: function 1 throws an error
E2: function 2 throws an error
H: the load is high
C: the program crashes
```

Let's translate the following English statements to propositional logic using only the logical connectives 
```
   NOT, AND, XOR, OR, IMPLIES, and IFF
```
and the four propositions above (E1,E2,H,C)

Assuming that 
* the precedence of the operators is as listed above (i.e. AND binds tightest and IFF binds weakest) and that 
* the implies operator is right associative (i.e.
```
   A implies B implies C
means 
   A implies (B implies C).
```
but the and, or, xor operators are left associate, that is,
```
  A or B xor C or D and E and F and G
means
(((A or B) xor C) or (((D and E) and F) and G)
```

Now let's translate ...

A. Both functions throw an error

**Answer:**  $E1 \wedge E2$   <br>  ```E1 AND E2```


B. If the load is high then at least one of the functions throws an error

**Answer:** $H \rightarrow (E1 \vee E2)$   <br> ```H IMPLIES ( E1 OR E2)```

and we can translate from logic to English

C.  Translate to English: $E1 \wedge H \rightarrow E2 \wedge C$

**Answer:** 
If function 1 throws and error and the load is high, then function 2 throws and error and the system crashes!

D. Translate to English: $\neg C \rightarrow \neg (E1 \vee E2)$

**Answer:**
If the system doesn't crash then neither function 1 or 2 throws an error.

E. Translate to English: $C \rightarrow E1 \vee (E2 \wedge H))$

**Answer:** 
if the system crashes then either function 1 throws an error, or function 2 throws an error and the load is high.

* The program crashes if two conditions hold: (1) the load is high and (2) one (or both) of the functions throws an error.

**Answer:**
$C \rightarrow H \wedge (E1 \vee E2)$

* Two things are true: (1) If the load is high the function 1 throws an error, and (2) if the load is low then the program crashes only if function 2 throws an error

**Answer:**
$(H \rightarrow E1) \wedge (\neg H \rightarrow (C \leftrightarrow E2))$

* The program keeps running (i.e. doesn't crash) only if both functions work correctly (i.e. neither function throws an error)

**Answer:**
$\neg C \rightarrow \neg(E1 \vee E2)$


* If the load is low, then the program crashes only if both functions throw an error

**Answer:** 
$\neg H \rightarrow (C \rightarrow E1\wedge E2$

* The program crashes if and only if function 1 throws an error when the load is high and function 2 throws an error when the load is low

**Answer:** 
$C \rightleftarrow (H\rightarrow E1) \wedge (\neg H \rightarrow E2)$

* If the program crashes then exactly one of the two functions throws an error

**Answer:**
$C \rightarrow E1 \oplus E2$

With E1, E2, H, and C as above, translate the following propositional logic formulas to English.
* $E1 \vee E2 \rightarrow C$

**Answer:**
if function 1 or function 2 throws an error, then they system will crash.

* $\neg H \rightarrow \neg C$

**Answer:**
if the load is low then the system won't crash.

* $(E1 \rightarrow H) \wedge (E2 \rightarrow C)$

**Answer:**
if function 1 throws an error then the load is high,
but if function 2 throws an error then the system crashes.

## Problem 2
Suppose we have the following Propositions;<br>
S = the shift key is pressed<br>
X = the X key is pressed<br>
E = the form is in edit mode<br>
A = an alert box pops up<br>

  not, and, xor, or, implies, iff. 

* the shift key and the X key are both pressed

**Answer:** 
$S \wedge X$

* if X is pressed and it is not in edit mode then an alert pops up

**Answer:**
$X \wedge \neg E \rightarrow A$

* the alert box pops up only if the shift key is pressed

**Answer:**
$A \rightarrow S$

* if the form is not in edit mode and the X key is pressed, then an alert pops up

**Answer:**
$\neg E \wedge X \rightarrow A$

* the alert box pops up when an X is typed if and only if the form is not in edit mode

**Answer:**
$(X \rightarrow A) \leftrightarrow \neg E$

* Either the shift key is pressed or the x key is pressed, but not both

**Answer:**
$S \oplus X$

* the form is in edit mode only if the shift key and the X key are pressed

**Answer:** 
$E \rightarrow S \wedge X$

* if the alert box pops up when the X key is pressed, then the form is not in edit mode

**Answer:**
$(X \rightarrow A) \rightarrow \neg E$


and translate the following formulas to English
* $\neg E \wedge \neg A$

**Answer:**
The program isn't in edit mode and the Alert box doesn't pop up.

* $A \rightarrow E \wedge X\wedge S$

**Answer:** 
if the alert box pops up, then the X key and shift key were pressed.
