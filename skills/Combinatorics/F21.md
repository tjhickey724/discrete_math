## Problem 1. Prove the following
**Theorem** Let $S$ be any set of 20 positive integers less than 10000, then there are at least 2 subsets of $S$ with the same sum.

## Problem 2, Prove the following
**Theorem** Show that if $S$ is any finite set with at least 2 elements, then any function $f:S \rightarrow S\times S$ can not be surjective,
and any function $g:S\times S \rightarrow S$ can not be injective..

This principle gets its name from the observation that if you have 11 pigeons that are roosting in 10 holes,
then one hole must contain at least 2 pigeons.

The idea is to imagine the domain of a function to be a flock of pigeons and the codomain to be a collection of pigeon holes,
and the function corresponds to the pigeons flying into pigeon holes. 
* The function is injective if
  * every pigeon has its own hole, or
  * each hole has at most one pigeon
* The function is surjective if
  * every hole contains at least one pigeon

Formally, we state it as follows:

**Theorem** Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a total function. If $\vert A\vert \gt \vert B \vert$,
then $f$ is not injective, that is there exists $a_1,a_2\in A$ with $a_1\not = a_2$ and $f(a_1)=f(a_2)$

**Proof:** We prove this by contradiction. If not, then $f$ is a bijection from $A$ onto its image $f(A)$
and so $A$ and $f(A)$ have the same size: $\vert f(A) \vert = \vert A \vert$.
But $f(A)\subseteq B$ so the size of $f(A)$ is smaller or equal to the size of $B$. 
Thus, $\vert A\vert = \vert f(A) \vert \le \vert B \vert$, which contradicts our
assumption that  $\vert A\vert > \vert B \vert$. **QED**

**Corollary** Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a total function. If $\vert A\vert \gt \vert B \vert$,
then  $\vert f^{-1}(b)\vert \ge 2$ for some $b\in B$.

**Proof:** this is just another way of saying that at least two elements of $A$ get mapped to the same
element of $B$, i.e. that $f$ is not 1-1.

We also have a similar theorem for when $A$ is much bigger than $B$.

**Theorem** Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a total function. If $\vert A\vert \gt k* \vert B \vert$ for some integer k>1,
then $\vert f^{-1}(b)\vert \ge k$ for some $b\in B$.

**Proof:** By contradiction. Suppose it is not true, then $\vert f^{-1}(b)\vert \lt k$ for every $b$ in $B$.
But this means that the size of $A$ is at most $k$ times the size of $B$ as $A$ is a disjoiont union of the inverse
images of points in $B$:

$$
A = \bigcup_\limits{b\in B} f^{-1}(b)
$$

and since this is a disjoint union

$$
\vert A \vert = \sum_\limits{b\in B} \vert  f^{-1}(b)\vert \le \sum_\limits{b\in B} k \le \vert B\vert *k
$$

and this contradicts our assumption that $\vert A\vert \gt k* \vert B \vert$  **QED**

## Problem 1. Prove the following
**Theorem** Let $S$ be any set of 20 positive integers less than 10000, then there are at least 2 subsets of $S$ with the same sum.

**Proof:** Let U be any subset of S, then the sum of U is at most 20*10,000 = 200,000. So if $f:P(S)\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is the
function that takes $U$ to the sum of the numbers in $U$, then the range of $f$ is contained in the interval $[20,200000]$.
But there are $2^{20}$ subsets of $S$ and $2^{20} = 1048576$ which is bigger than 200,000 so
$f$ is not 1-1, and hence there are at least two subsets of $S$ with the same sum. ***QED***

Here is such a set of numbers:

$\\{104, 1077, 1724, 2236, 2543, 3354, 3791, 4192, 4437, 4980, 5887, 6520, 7335, 7611, 8925, 8977, 9191, 9384, 9752, 9753\\}$

We don't know which two subsets have the same sum, but we know they have to exist!
(You can write a little Python program to find subsets with the same sum. For this example, these two subsets
have the same sum $\\{104, 2236, 3354, 9384\\}$ and  $\\{5887, 9191\\}$ these both to 15078 and if we add any other element x  to both of these sets the new sets also have the same sum: 15078+x
