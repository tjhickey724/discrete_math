# F18: Combinatorics: Addition and Multipication Principles
# Basic Counting Technqiues
Here we introduce the simplest (and yet still powerful) counting techniques.

Recall that if $A$ is a finite set then we use the notation $\vert A \vert$ to denote the size
of the set.

# The Multiplication Principle:
_The size of a product of sets, is the product of their sizes_

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets, then
* $\vert A \times B \vert = \vert A \vert\ *\  \vert B \vert$

and
* $\vert A^n \vert \ = \ \vert A\vert^n$

and more generally, if $\\{A_i | 1\le i\le n\\}$ is a finite collection of sets, then
* $\vert \prod_\limits{i=1}^n A_i\vert \ = \ \prod_\limits{i=1}^n \vert A_i\vert$

### Applications

**How many binary sequences of length $n$ are there?**

If we let $B=\\{0,1\\}$ be the set of two bits, then $B^n$ is the set of binary sequences of length $n$,
and by the multiplication principle, $\vert B^n\vert \  = \ \vert B\vert^n \  = \ 2^n$. So there are $2^n$
binary sequences of length $n$

**License Plates**
Current Massachusetts license plates (as of 2023) have the form D LLL DD
where D is a digit and L is a letter. How many different license plates can there be?

If we let $L$ be set of 26 letters and $D$ be the set of 10 digits, then each license plate
is an element of $D\times L^3\times D^2$ and the size of this set is

$\vert D\times L^3\times D^2\vert = \vert D \vert^3 * \vert L \vert^3 = 1000*26^3 = 17,576,000$

# The Addition Principle
_The size of a disjoint unions of sets is the sum of their sizes_

Suppose $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets, then
* $\vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A \vert\ +\  \vert B \vert$

and if $A_i$ are disjoint sets, then
* $\vert \bigcup_\limits{i=1}^n A_i\vert \ = \ \sum_\limits{i=1}^n \vert A_i\vert$

This follows directly from what it means for two sets to be disjoint.

### Applications
**Passwords**
Suppose that on a particular system a valid password must have 6,7,or 8 symbols
and the first must be a letter while the rest can be letters or digits. What is the size
of the set $V$ of all valid passwords?

If we let $L$ be the set of 26 letters and $D$ the set of 10 digits, and $S$ the set of 36 letters or digits.
Then we can use the product rule to calculate the number of passwords of length 6 (V6), length 7 (V7) and length 8 (V8).
Since these are disjoint sets, we add their sizes to get the size of $V$.

* $\vert V6 \vert = \vert L \vert * \vert S \vert^5 = 26*36^5$
* $\vert V7 \vert = \vert L \vert * \vert S \vert^6= 26*36^6$
* $\vert V8 \vert = \vert L \vert * \vert S \vert^7= 26*36^7$
* $\vert V \vert = \vert V6\vert + \vert V7\vert + \vert V8\vert = 26 * 36^5 +26 * 36^6 +26 * 36^7$

So the total number of valid passwords is $26 * 36^5 +26 * 36^6 +26 * 36^7$.

# Sample Problems
1. How many license plates are there that have the form DDDLLL where D is a digit and L is a letter?
2. Suppose the rules for a username are that it has to be between 4 and 8 characters and the only characters that are allowed are the 26 lower case letters, the 9 digits, and 3 symbols (. - and _). How many such passwords are there?
3. How many 4 character usernames are there, if they must start with a letter (upper or lower case) but can have letters or digits for the remaining characters?
4. Octal numbers use the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 to create numbers. The only restriction is they can't start with 0. How many 5 digit octal numbers are there?
5. Hexadecimal numbers use the digits 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and the letters a,b,c,d,e,f to create numerals where a=10, b=11, c=12, d=13, e=14, and f=15 in a base 16 number system.  Each hexadecimal number can be represented in binary by a 4 bit number, and so hex is often used as an alternative to binary. Every internet IP address consists of 32 bits which is 8 hex digits. How many 8 digit hexadecimal numbers are there?  This is the same as the number of IPV4 internet addresses...
