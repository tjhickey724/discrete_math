# Skill Description

Ability to determine the size of a set using a combination of the techniques covered in this course.

# Sample Problems

## Problem 1. No pairs in non-face card hands
Suppose we are playing cards with no face cards, that is cards with rank 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.
How many 5 card hands are there that contain no pairs (but a flush or a straight are OK)?

## Problem 2. Number of flushes
How many 5 card hands are there, with a regular 52 card deck, that are flushes (i.e. all cards
have the same suit?)

# Tutorial
This skill just involves solving problems that requires multiple different combinatorics skills.
The Card Counting problems are good examples of this...


# Answers

## Problem 1. No pairs in non-face card hands
Suppose we are playing cards with no face cards, that is cards with rank 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.
How many 5 card hands are there that contain no pairs (but a flush or a straight are OK)?

**Answer:** if a five card hand has no pairs, then all five ranks have to be different.
So there are (9 choose 5) ways to choose 5 different ranks out of 9. Then we must choose the suits
of those 5 cards and there are $4^5$ such choices, so the answer is

$$\binom 9 5 * 4^5 = 9 * 7 * 2 * 2^{10} $$

## Problem 2. Number of flushes
How many 5 card hands are there, with a regular 52 card deck, that are flushes (i.e. all cards have the same suit?)

**Answer:** We first have to choose the suit, and there are 4 such choices, then we choose any set of 5 ranks from the 13 cards of that suit.
which gives

$$ 4 * \binom{13}{5}$$
