# F20: Combinatorics: The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (PIE)

Ability to count the sizes of sets defined intersections and unions of multiple sets.

## PIE for two sets

**Theorem.** If $A$ and $B$ are sets then

$$\vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert - \vert A\cap B \vert$$

**Proof:**
we can write $A\cup B$ as the disjoint union of three sets
* $AB = A\cap B$ the intersection
* $A' = A - AB$
* $B' = B - AB$

By the addition principle the size of $A\cup B$ is the sum of the sizes of these sets:

$$\vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A - AB\vert + \vert B - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert$$

but we also know that 
* $\vert A \vert = \vert A - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert$
* $\vert B\vert = \vert B - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert$

and so adding these together we get

$$ \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert - \vert A\cap B\vert $$

$$=  \vert A - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert +  \vert B - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert - \vert AB \vert$$

$$=\vert A - AB\vert  +  \vert B - AB\vert  + \vert AB \vert$$

$$ = \vert A \cup B \vert$$

**Q.E.D.**


## PIE for three or more sets
The PIE rule can be generalized to larger numbers of sets though it becomes difficult to use for 4 or more sets.
Here is the form for 3 sets

**Theorem.** If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets then

$$\vert A \cup B \cup C \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert+ \vert C \vert  - \vert A\cap B \vert - \vert A\cap C \vert - \vert B\cap C \vert + \vert A\cap B \cap C\vert$$

This can be proved in the same way as for the case of two sets.  We draw the Venn diagram and express $A$,$B$, and $C$ as disjoint unions of the subsets in the Venn Diagrams and then do the same calculation as above.

For larger interesections you alternately add and subtract the intersections of increasing numbers of sets
