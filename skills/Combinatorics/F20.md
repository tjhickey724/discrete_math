# Sample Problems

1. Let $A$ be the set of all playing cards that are in the Hearts suit and let $B$ be the set of face cards, i.e. those with rank $J,Q,K,A$.  What is the size of the set $A\cup B$

2. Let $A_k$ be the set of numbers in $\\{1,2,\ldots,100\\}$ that are multiples of $k$. So $A_30 = \\{30,60,90\\}$. What is the size of $A_2\cup A_3\cup A_5$, i.e. the numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, or 5.

## PIE for two sets

**Theorem.** If $A$ and $B$ are sets then

$$\vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert - \vert A\cap B \vert$$

**Proof:**
we can write $A\cup B$ as the disjoint union of three sets
* $AB = A\cap B$ the intersection
* $A' = A - AB$
* $B' = B - AB$

By the addition principle the size of $A\cup B$ is the sum of the sizes of these sets:

$$\vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A - AB\vert + \vert B - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert$$

but we also know that 
* $\vert A \vert = \vert A - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert$
* $\vert B\vert = \vert B - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert$

and so adding these together we get

$$ \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert - \vert A\cap B\vert $$

$$=  \vert A - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert +  \vert B - AB\vert + \vert AB \vert - \vert AB \vert$$

$$=\vert A - AB\vert  +  \vert B - AB\vert  + \vert AB \vert$$

$$ = \vert A \cup B \vert$$

**Q.E.D.**


## PIE for three or more sets
The PIE rule can be generalized to larger numbers of sets though it becomes difficult to use for 4 or more sets.
Here is the form for 3 sets

**Theorem.** If $A$, $B$, and $C$ are sets then

$$\vert A \cup B \cup C \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert+ \vert C \vert  - \vert A\cap B \vert - \vert A\cap C \vert - \vert B\cap C \vert + \vert A\cap B \cap C\vert$$

This can be proved in the same way as for the case of two sets.  We draw the Venn diagram and express $A$,$B$, and $C$ as disjoint unions of the subsets in the Venn Diagrams and then do the same calculation as above.

For larger interesections you alternately add and subtract the intersections of increasing numbers of sets

1. Let $A$ be the set of all playing cards that are in the Hearts suit and let $B$ be the set of face cards, i.e. those with rank $J,Q,K,A$.  What is the size of the set $A\cup B$

**Answer:** 
$A$ contains 13 elements and $B$ contains $4*4=16$ as there are 4 ranks and 4 suits for face cards. To find the size of the union we need to find the intersection $A\cap B$ which is the face cards in the Hearts suit which has 4 elements. So, by PIE, we get $\vert A\cup B \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B \vert - \vert A\cap B\vert = 13+16 - 4 = 25$

2. Let $A_k$ be the set of numbers in $\\{1,2,\ldots,100\\}$ that are multiples of $k$. So $A_30 = \\{30,60,90\\}$. What is the size of $A_2\cup A_3\cup A_5$, i.e. the numbers that are divisible by 2, 3, or 5.

**Answer:**
First observe that $\vert A_n\vert = 100//n$ where we are using $//$ to denote integer division, i.e. dividing and then throwing away the remainder. Also note that $A_n \cap A_m = A_{LCM(n,m)}$ where $LCM(n,m)$ is the least common multiple of n and m. Using this we can calculate the sizes of $A_2$, $A_3$, $A_5$ and their intersections:

$\vert A_2 \vert = 100//2 = 50$

$\vert A_3 \vert = 100//3 = 33$

$\vert A_5 \vert = 100//5 = 20$

$\vert A_2 \cap A_3 \vert = \vert A_6 \vert = 100//6 = 16$

$\vert A_2 \cap A_5 \vert = \vert A_{10} \vert = 100//10 = 10$

$\vert A_3 \cap A_5 \vert = \vert A_{15} \vert = 100//15 = 6$

$\vert A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_5 \vert = \vert A_{30} \vert = 100//30 = 3$

So by PIE,

$\vert A_2 \cup A_3 \cup A_5 \vert = 50+33+20 - 16 -10 -6 + 3 = 103 - 32 + 3 = 71+3 = 74$
