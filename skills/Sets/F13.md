# F13: Sets: Algebra

Ability to using Boolean algebra to reason about sets. 
In particular, 
* to simplify formulas using boolean algebra laws with union, interection and complement
* to prove (or disprove) logical inferences about set formulas``

## Relations on sets
We define the "subseteq" and "subset" relations on sets as follows:
* $A\subseteq B \equiv \forall x.  (x\in A) \rightarrow (x\in B)$
* $A\subset B \equiv A\ne B \wedge A\subseteq B$

## Set Operations
The fundamental operations on sets $A$ and $B$ are
* union -  
  $A\cup B = \\{x | (x\in A) \vee (x\in B) \\}$
* intersection -  
  $A\cap B = \\{x | (x\in A) \wedge (x\in B) \\}$
* difference -  
  $A-B = \\{x | (x\in A) \wedge \neg (x\in B) \\}$
* complement -  
  $\overline{A} = \\{x\in \cal{U} | \neg(x\in A) \\}$  
  where $\cal{U}$ is some universal domain that contains $A$ and $B$.
  and is usually clear by context. We also write it using the superscript "c" -
  $A^c = \overline{A}$
* powerset -  
  ${\cal P}(A)$ = the set of all subsets of A including the empty set $\emptyset$ and the set $A$ itself.
  We sometimes write the powerset as $2^{A}$ since if $A$ has $n$ elements then ${\cal P}(A)$ has $2^n$ elements.

We can represent a union or interection of a collection of sets $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ as follows:
* $\bigcup_\limits{i=1}^n S_i = S_1 \cup \ldots \cup S_n$
* $\bigcap_\limits{i=1}^n S_i = S_1 \cap \ldots \cap S_n$

## Exercise 1
Let 
* $A=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$,
* $B=\\{5,6,7,8,9,0\\}$
* $C=\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$,
* ${\cal U}=\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$

What is
* $A\cup B$
* $A\cap B$
* $\overline{C}$
* $A\cap C$
* $A\cap B$
* $C \cap (A\cup B)$
* $C \cup (A \cap B)$
