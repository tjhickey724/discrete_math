# Skill Description
```
Ability to work with modern set notation. In particular, the ability to list the elements
of a finite set defined using set comprehension notation including subsets of product sets and power sets.

Let $N=\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\}$ be the natural numbers, and let
$F_3 = \\{0,1,2\\}$

Each of the sets below contains a (small) finite number of elements. 
List the elements explicitly. For example, for 
$U = \\{x \in N: x < 5\\}$ then answer would be $U=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$.

1. List the elements of $A = \\{3x+1 : (x\in N) \wedge (x\in [2,4])\\}$
2. List the elements of $B = P(F_3)$
3. List the elements of $C = \\{(a,S) \in F_2 \times P(F_2) : a\not\in S \\}$
4. List the elements of $C = \\{(n,S) \in F_3 \times P(F_2) : n \ne \vert S \vert \\}$ where $\vert S\vert$ is the number of elements in the set $S$

## Tutorial 
### on Syntax and Semantics of Sets
What we are looking for in this skill is a basic understanding of the standard set notation.

A set is a collection of distinct elements.

Sets can be described using a list of items separated by commas inside curly braces, e.g.

$\\{ a, b, c\\}$

We use the notation

$x\in A$ 

to express the predicate that the element $x$ is in the set $A$.

Some common sets of numbers have their own symbols
* $\emptyset$ = the empty set = $\\{\\}$
* $\mathbb{N}$ = the natural numbers = $\\{0,1,2,\ldots \\}$
* $\mathbb{Z}$ = the integers = $\\{ \ldots, -2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots \\}$
* $\mathbb{Q}$ = the rational numbers
* $\mathbb{R}$ = the real numbers
* $\mathbb{C}$ = the complex numbers
* $\mathbb{F}_n = {0,1,\ldots,n-1}$ the natural numbers less than $n$
  We will also write this as ${\cal F}_n$

We can use a superscript '+' or '-' to indicate the positive or negative elements in the set
* $\mathbb{Z}^+$ = positive integers
* $\mathbb{R}^-$ = negative real numbers

## Set Comprehensions
Another way to express a set is to specify the set as a the elements x of another set S satisfying some relation P(x). Here is the notation

$\\{x \in S | P(x) \\}$ or $\\{x \in S : P(x) \\}$

the ":" or "|" can be read "such that" or "for"

* odds = $\\{ x\in \mathbb{Z} : \exists a\in \mathbb{Z} . (x = 2a+1)\\}$
  the set of all integers x such that x = 2a+1 for some integer a
* odds = $\\{ 2x+1 | x \in \mathbb{Z} \\}$
  the set of numbers of the form 2x+1 for all integers x

## Intervals
We use the following notation to represent intervals in the integers, rationals, or reals:

$[a,b] = \\{x : a\le x\le b]$

$[a,b) = \\{x : a\le x\lt b]$

$(a,b] = \\{x : a\lt x\le b]$

$(a,b) = \\{x : a\lt x\lt b]$

The bracket or parenthesis indicates that the endpoint is  or is not in the set.
Note we can write $\mathbb{F}_n$ as $[0,n)$ or $[0,n-1]$. For example, 
* $[2,5] = \\{2,3,4,5\\}$
* $[0,7) = \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$

# Answers
## 1. List the elements of $A = \\{3x+1 : (x\in N) \wedge (x\in [2,4])\\}$
   Since we are looking for natural numbers in the range [2,4], this is the set $\\{2,3,4\\}$
   and were looking at the set of all numbers $3x+1$ for those values of x, so the answer is
   $A = \\{7,10,13\\}$

## 2. List the elements of $B = P(F_3)$
$F_3=\\{0,1,2\\}$ is the set of the first 3 natural numbers. The power set of $F_3$ consists of all 8 of its subsets.
So $B$ is

$\\{\\}$

$\\{0\\}$

$\\{1\\}$

$\\{2\\}$

$\\{0,1\\}$

$\\{0,2\\}$

$\\{1,2\\}$

$\\{0,1,2\\}$

The most common errors with this are not using curly braces for the sets, or forgetting to include the empty set $\\{\\}$.

## 3. List the elements of $C = \\{(a,S) \in F_2 \times P(F_2) : a\not\in S \\}$
$F_2 = \\{0,1\\}$ and $P(F_2) = \\{\\{\\},\\{0\\},\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}\\}$
The product set $F_2\times P(F_2)$ consists of all pairs $(a,S)$ were $a$ is 0 or 1, and $S$ is a subset of $F_2$
The set C is the set of all such pairs where $a$ is not an element of $S. So the elements of $C$ are

$(0,\\{\\})$

$(0,\\{1\\})$

$(1,\\{\\})$

$(1,\\{0\\})$

The most common error here is not correctly using parentheses for the pair and curly braces for the set.

## 4. List the elements of $C = \\{(n,S) \in F_3 \times P(F_2) : n \ne \vert S \vert \\}$ where $\vert S\vert$ is the number of elements in the set $S$

$F_3\times P(F_2)$ consists of $3\times 2^2=12$ elements and we are removing 4 of them, those were $n=\vert S\vert$
That leaves the following ..

$(0,\\{0\\})$ $(0,\\{1\\})$ $(0,\\{0,1\\})$ 

$(1,\\{\\})$ $(1,\\{0,1\\})$

$(2,\\{\\})$ $(2,\\{0\\})$ $(2,\\{1\\})$

The most common errors here are not using the correct brackets (parentheses for the tuple and curly braces for the set),
or misunderstanding the constraint $n\ne \vert S \vert$



## More problems
Describe the following sets in English and list a few of their elements, if they aren't empty
1. A = $\\{x\in \mathbb{Z} | \exists y\in \mathbb{Z} \ (x=y^2)\\}$
2. B = $\\{x \in \mathbb{Z} | \sqrt{x}\in \mathbb{Q}\\}$
3. C = $\\{x \in \mathbb{R} | x^2 \lt 9 \\}$
4. D = $\\{x \in \mathbb{N} | 10 - x \in \mathbb{N} \\}$
5. Is $A \subseteq B$?
6. What would it mean if $A=B$? (Is it true?)
7. What is $\overline{C} \cap D$?
8. Let $F_3 = \\{0,1,2\\}$, what is the powerset ${\cal P}(F_3)$ of $F_3$. Write down its elements.
