# Sample-Problems

## Problem 1
Let $S$ be the sample space of rolls of 1 six-sided die and let $R_1(\omega)$ be the
value that is rolled. What is the expected value of $R$ assuming the die is fair?
What if the die is loaded so that "1" appears 50% of the time and the other 5 numbers
appear $10% of the time?
Suppose we are rolling $k$ dice, let $R_k$ be the random variable that sums the values on
the dice. What is the expected value of $R_2$?

## Problem 2
Let $S$ be the sample space of all finite sequences of coin flips.
Let $R(\omega)$ be the position of the first "tails" in the coin flip, so $R(HHHT)=4$
What is the expected value of $R$?


## Problem 3
Let $S$ be the sample space of all craps games, i.e. an outcome is a sequence of dice rolls
that might appear in a game of Craps. Let $R$ be the random variable which counts the length
of the game, i.e. the number of time the dice were rolled.  How would you calculate the
expected value of $R$, i.e. the averate length of a game of craps?

The rules of craps are:
```
The first roll is called the "come-out roll"
If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the player wins immediately (game ends)
If the come-out roll is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses immediately (game ends)
If the come-out roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes the "point"
The player continues rolling until either:

The point is rolled again (player wins)
A 7 is rolled (player loses)
```

## Random Variables

A **random variable** X on a probability space is a total function whose domain is the sample space.

Since we are assuming the sample space $S$ is either finite or countable infinite, the range of a random
variable is either finite or countably infinite, and the outcomes where $X$ takes a given value can be viewed
as events written as
* ${\rm Pr}(X=k)$

Two random variables $R_1$ and $R_2$ are said to be independent provided these events are all independent, that is

$R_1$ and $R_2$ are said to be **independent random variables** by definition if forall $j$ and $k$ we have
* ${\rm Pr}[R_1=j]$ and ${\rm Pr}[R_2=k]$ are independent events

$$
{\rm Pr}[(R_1=j) \wedge (R_2=k)] = {\rm Pr}[R_1=j] * {\rm Pr}[R_2=k] 
$$

Making the assumption that two random variables are independent makes it easier to reason about them
because knowing the value of one variable doesn't impact the value of the other, that is

* ${\rm Pr}[(R_1=j) \ \vert \ (R_2=k)]$
* $= {\rm Pr}[(R_1=j) \wedge (R_2=k)]/{\rm Pr}[R_2=k]$  by definition of conditional probability
* $= {\rm Pr}[R_1=j] * {\rm Pr}[R_2=k] /{\rm Pr}[R_2=k]$ by definition of independence
* $=  {\rm Pr}[R_1=j]$ by algebra assuming ${\rm Pr}[R_2=k] \not - 0$

If we can reasonably believe that two variables are independent, it makes it much easier to reason about them.


## Expected Value, a generalization of the mean

The **expected value** $E(R)$ of a random varaible $R$ on a probability space with sample space $S$ is defined to be

$$
{\rm E}[R] = \sum_\limits{\omega\in S} R(\omega)\ {\rm Pr}[\omega]
$$


When $S$ is a finite set and every outcome has the same probability, this gives the mean of that set of values!
Expected value is more general than the mean as it allows for non-uniform distributions and even infinite sample
spaces.

We can also define the expected value in terms of larger events than outcomes.

**Theorem** 
The expectation is the weighted average of all values in the range of $R$
where the weights are the probability the variable takes that value, i.e.

$$
{\rm E}[R] = \sum_\limits{k\in R(S)} k\ {\rm Pr}[R=k]
$$



## Applications to Computer Science
A very common application of random variables is to estimate the average esecution time $T$ for a program.
The sample space is the set of all inputs $\omega$, the random variable is the execution time $T(\omega)$ on a particular input,
the events of interest are $E_1,E_2,\ldots$ where $E_k$ is the set of inputs of size $k$ and we want to find
a formula for the expected value of $T$ when we restrict $S$ to the inputs of size $k$, or when we model 
a distribution which occurs in practice, i.e. what is the probablity that the program be give input $\omega$.

One classic example is to compute the average execution time for sorting algorithms such as quicksort. 
But this also comes up when analyzing the efficiency of a web app where you can model the likelihood of 
particular inputs from the users (e.g. google searches!)

## Problem 1
Let $S$ be the sample space of rolls of 1 six-sided die and let $R_1(\omega)$ be the
value that is rolled. What is the expected value of $R$ assuming the die is fair?

_If the die is fair, then each outcome has probability 1/6, so the expected value $E$ is_

$$ \frac 1 6 \sum_{i=1}^6 i = \frac {1+2+3+4+5+6} 6 = \frac {21} 6 = 3.5 $$

What if the die is loaded so that "1" appears 50% of the time and the other 5 numbers
appear $10% of the time?

$$
$ = 0.5 * 1 + 0.1 * (2+3+4+5+6) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.1*20 = 0.5 + 2.0 = 2.5 
$$

Suppose we are rolling $k$ dice, let $R_k$ be the random variable that sums the values on
the dice. What is the expected value of $R_2$?

_There are 36 outcomes (all the pairs (i,j) with $i,j\in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ 
So we use the formula for computing the expected value by computing the probability of each event $Pr[R=k]$ for
all possible $k$, that is $k\in [2,12]$_

$Pr[R=2]  = 1/36$ with outcomes, (1,1)

$Pr[R=3]  = 2/36$ with outcomes, (1,2),(2,1)

$Pr[R=4]  = 3/36$ with outcomes (1,3),(2,2),(3,1)

$Pr[R=5]  = 4/36$ with outcomes (1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)

$Pr[R=6]  = 5/36$ with outcomes (1,5),(2,4),(3,3),(4,2),(5,1)

$Pr[R=7]  = 6/36$ with outcomes (1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1)

$Pr[R=8]  = 5/36$ with outcomes (2,6),(3,5),(4,4),(5,3),(6,2)

$Pr[R=9]  = 4/36$ with outcomes (3,6),(4,5),(5,4),(6,3)

$Pr[R=10] = 3/36$ with outcomes (4,6),(5,5),(6,4)

$Pr[R=11] = 2/36$ with outcomes (5,6),(6,5))

$Pr[R=12] = 1/36$ with outcomes (6,6) 

_So the expected value is_

$$
E = \sum_{k=1}^{12} k Pr[R=k] = 
2 * \frac 1 {36} + 3 * \frac 2 {36} + 4 * \frac 3 {36} + 5 * \frac 4 {36} + 6 * \frac 5 {36} + 7 * \frac 6 {36} + 8 * \frac 5 {36} + 9 * \frac 4 {36} + 10 * \frac 3 {36} + 11 * \frac 2 {36} + 12 * \frac 1 {36}
$$

$$
= (2 + 6 + 12 + 20 +30 + 42 + 40 + 36 + 30 + 22 + 12)/36 = 252/36 = 7
$$

_We could have guessed this though by noting that 2 and 12 have equal probabilities and their average value is 7;
likewise for 3 and 11, 4 and 10, 5 and 9, 6 and 8, and 7. All have averages of 7 so the total average will be 7._

_We could do the same though assuming you have die which are not balanced, and have different probabilities for each single die outcome._

## Problem 2
Let $S$ be the sample space of all finite sequences of coin flips.
Let $R(\omega)$ be the position of the first "tails" in the coin flip, so $R(HHHT)=4$
What is the expected value $E$ of $R$?

_We can solve this by looking at an infinite tree of outcomes, calculating the probability of each one, and evaluating the resulting series._

Observe that the probability of flipping $n$ heads and then a tail is $R[H^n T] = 0.5^{n+1}$ to get $n+1$ flips, so the expected value is_

$$
E = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)0.5^{n+1} = 0.5 * \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)0.5^n
$$

but recall from the generalized binomial theorem that

$$
\frac 1 {(1-t)^2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)t^n
$$

So

$$ E = 0.5 \left (\frac 1 {(1-0.5)^2} \right ) = 0.5 (\frac 1 {1/4}) = 0.5 * 4 = 2 $$


_We can also observe that there is a 50% chance it has length 1 if we flip a tail on the first try. There is also a 50% chance that we flip a head, and the average numher of additional flips after the head will be E, so the average number of flips including that initial H is E+1,
so we get_

$$
E = 0.5 + 0.5 * (E+1) = 1 + 0.5 E
$$

Solving this we get $0.5E = 1$ so $E = 2$.

## Problem 3
Let $S$ be the sample space of all craps games, i.e. an outcome is a sequence of dice rolls
that might appear in a game of Craps. Let $R$ be the random variable which counts the length
of the game, i.e. the number of time the dice were rolled.  How would you calculate the
expected value of $R$, i.e. the averate length of a game of craps?

The rules of craps are:
```
The first roll is called the "come-out roll"
If the come-out roll is 7 or 11, the player wins immediately (game ends)
If the come-out roll is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses immediately (game ends)
If the come-out roll is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes the "point"
The player continues rolling until either:

The point is rolled again (player wins)
A 7 is rolled (player loses)
```
