# Sample-Problems

## Problem 1
Calculate the probabilities of various "hands" drawn from a deck of cards, e.g.
* What is the probability of drawing 2 Aces from a deck of cards?
* What is the probability of getting a hand with 4 aces?
* What is the probability of getting a 4 of a kind hand?
* What is the probability of rolling 5 dice and getting a full house?
* What is the probability of flipping a coin 3 times and getting heads exactly twice?
* What is the probability of flipping a weighted coin (p heads, 1-p tails) three times and getting heads exactly twice?


## Problem 2
Calculate the conditional probability using the following example from the MIT text.

Two teams, A and B, are playing a 3 game tournament and the first team to win 2 games wins the tournament.

Team A also has the following property. If the win a game, then they are enthused and the probability they win their next game is 2/3.
If they lose, then they are demoralized and the probability they win the next game is 1/3.  Find the probability that they win the tournament
assuming they win the first game. Draw the tree, identify the events of interest, calculate the probabilities of each outcome (assume that team A wins the first game with probability 1/2), then calculate the probabilities of the events and use the definition of conditional probability in terms
of usual probability to find the answer.



## Problem 3
## Exercise 2
Use Bayes rule to calculate the "probability" that the team won their first game, if we know they won the tournament....
This does raise philosophical issues!

## Definitions
A **Sample Space** is countable set S (finite or infinite)
* the elements of a sample space $S$ are called **outcomes**
* a subset of S is called an **event**


A **Probability Function** on a sample space $S$ is a total function ${\rm Pr}:S\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
  from $S$ to the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ such that 
* ${\rm Pr}[\omega]\ge 0$ for all $\omega \in S$
* $\sum_\limits{\omega in S} {\rm Pr}[\omega] = 1$

A **Probability Space** is a Sample Space with a Probability function.

A Probability Space is **uniform** if ${\rm Pr}[\omega]$ is the same for all $\omega$ in $S$.
This only makes sense for finite sample spaces...

# The Four Step Method

One of the most fundamental skills in probability is determining the likelihood of a particular outcome for a clearly specified sequence of events.

In many cases, we can rigorously calculate such probabilities by following a four step approach, whoch we have taken from the text book Mathematics for Computer Science....
We will follow the book and show how these apply in the "Let's make a deal" scenario.

For the TV show,  "Let's make a deal", the contestant would see three doors. One of which would contain a prize. The player would pick a door.
The host would open one of the other two doors, showing it didn't have a prize behind it and would then ask the contestant if they wanted to change their choice.
The question we have here is whether the contestant should change their choice.  We'll follow the four steps below to come to a decision, or you can read
the text which explains each of these three steps.

## Step 1: Find the Sample Space....
Our goal is to determine the likelihood of some particular event, so the first step is to find the set of all possible events of which our events are a subset.
These events will often be describe by a sequence of choices. 
In the "Let's make a deal" example, the sample space is all possible outcomes where the prize is placed behind a door, the user picks a door, and the host opens one of the doors that doesn't contain the prize, and the player either decides to stay with their choice or to change to the other door.

For more examples consider the following: being dealt five cards from a deck of 52 cards, or being given 1000 zip codes, or tracing a path
from the root of tree down to one of its leaves.... This first step is to use the definition of the events to create a set of all possible events, the sample space, 
and to define it mathematically in a way that we can analyze it.

## Step 2: Identify events of interest.
Once we've defined the sample space, we need to clearly specify which events we are interested in... what are the events whose likelihood we want to calculate.\
For the "Let's make a deal" example, the events of interest are when the user's choice results in picking a door with a prize behind it.

For the other cases, the interesting events might be
the five card hands containing a full house, or the zip codes from regions with a majority of senior citizens, or paths in a tree of a particular length.

## Step 3: Determine outcome probabilities
For each of the possible outcomes in the sample space we need to determine how likely that particular outcome is.  We usually use our understanding of the choice made
to get that outcome to calculate the probability.

## Step 4: Compute the Event Probabilities
Once we know the probability of each outcome and we know which outcomes we are interested in, we can simply add up those probabilities to get the overall probability for
our particular kind of event.

# Examples
We will work through these examples in class to make sure you understand the readings....
* The "Mathematics for Computer Science" text goes through these four steps in detail for the "Let's make a deal" problem.
* Card games provide many examples where calculating probabilities can be helpful. For example, suppose you have been dealt three cards
  the A,2,3 of hearts, what is the probability that after being dealt two more cards you will have a three of a kind? or a straight? or a flush?
  If someone else already has 3 fours, what is the probability that you will beat them with the next two cards?
* The MIT book also has an interesting example about dice games with non-standard dice, that is quite unintuitive.



## The Birthday Principle
The MIT text finds a formula in Chapter 16.4 for the probability $b(d,n)$ that a sequence of size n
with elements from a set of size d has no duplicate elements, assuming they are chosen from 
a uniform distribution. The estimate they prove is

$$
b(d,n) = P(d,n)/d^n =\frac{d(d-1)\ldots(d-n+1)}{d * d * \ldots * d}=
\left (\frac{1}{1-\frac 1d}\right ) \left (\frac{1}{1-\frac 2d}\right ) \ldots\left (\frac{1}{1-\frac{n-1}{d}}\right ) 
\lt e^{-\frac 1d} e^{-\frac 2d} \ldots e^{-\frac {n-1}{d}} = e^{-(n(n-1)/2d}
$$

As a rule of thumb if we substitute in $d = n^2/2$ we get $b(d,n)< e{-1} \approx 0.368$ and this is a fairly good estimate.
Note that if $d=n^2/2$ then $n = \sqrt{2d}$

**Birthday Principle** The probability that a sequence of size $\sqrt{2d}$ taken from a set of size $d$ will have duplicate elements is about $1-\frac 1e \approx 0.632$.

## Properties of Probability functions.
We define the probability of an event $E$ to the the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in $E$
* ${\rm Pr}[E] = \sum_\limits{\omega\in E} {\rm Pr}[\omega]$

Because a probability function is a function on subsets of $S$ we can easily prove several very useful identities, e.g.

* ${\rm Pr}[E_1 \cup E_2] = {\rm Pr}[E_1] + {\rm Pr}[E_2]$ if $E_1$ and $E_2$ are disjoint subsets of $S$.
* ${\rm Pr}[E_1 \cup E_2] = {\rm Pr}[E_1] + {\rm Pr}[E_2] - {\rm Pr}[E_1\cap E_2] \le {\rm Pr}[E_1] + {\rm Pr}[E_2]$ for any events $E_1$, $E_2$
* ${\rm Pr}[\overline{E}]  = 1 - {\rm Pr}[E]$ where $\overline{E}$ is the complement of $E$, i.e. $\overline{E} = S-E$
* ${\rm Pr}[E_1 - E_2] = {\rm Pr}[E_1] - {\rm Pr}[E_1\cap E_2]$
* if $A\subseteq B$ then ${\rm Pr}[A] \le {\rm Pr}[B]$
* ${\rm Pr}[\bigcup_\limits{i=1}^\infty E_i] \le  \sum_\limits{i=1}^\infty {\rm Pr}[E_i]$

We sometimes use logic operations instead of set operations on events since 
* the event $E_1\cup E_2$ can be viewed as $E_1 \vee E_2$ occurring, and
* the event $E_1\cap E_2$ can be viewed as $E_1 \wedge E_2$ occurring, and
* the event $\overline{E_1}$ can be viewed as the outcomes where $\neg E_1$


## Conditional Probability
We use the notation ${\rm Pr}[E \vert F]$ for the probability that event $E$ occurs, assuming that event $F$ also occurs. It is defined set-theoretically as follows:

$$
{\rm Pr}[E \vert F] = \frac{{\rm Pr}[E \cap F]}{ {\rm Pr}[F]}
$$

**Lemma** 
* ${\rm Pr}[E \cap F]   = {\rm Pr}[F] \ {\rm Pr}[E \vert F]$
* ${\rm Pr}[E_1 \cap E_2 \cap E_3]   = {\rm Pr}[E_1] \ {\rm Pr}[E_2 \vert E_1]  \ {\rm Pr}[E_3 \vert E_1 \cap E_2] $

**Proof:**  For the first, multiply both sides of the defintion by ${\rm Pr}[F]$.
For the second replace the conditional probabilities with their defintions and everything cancels out. **QED**



## Bayes Rule
Baye's rule allows one to calculate the "inverse" of conditional probabilities.

$$
{\rm Pr}[B \vert A]   = \frac{{\rm Pr}[B] \ {\rm Pr}[A\vert B]}{ {\rm Pr}[A]}
$$

This follow easily from the fact that ${\rm Pr}[A \cap B]   = {\rm Pr}[B] \ {\rm Pr}[A \vert B]$



## Independent Events
An event A is independent of an event B if ${\rm Pr}[B]=0$ or if ${\rm Pr}[B]\not = 0$ and
* ${\rm Pr}[A \vert B] = {\rm Pr}[A]$

Unrolling the defintion of conditional probability
* ${\rm Pr}[A \vert B]  =  {\rm Pr}[A \cap B] / {\rm Pr}[B]$

We see that A is indepent of B if an only if 
* ${\rm Pr}[A \cap B] = {\rm Pr}[A]\  {\rm Pr}[B]$

In other words, the probability that A and B both occur is the product of their probabilities of occuring individually.
If we assume that two events are independent, it makes them much easier to work with!


  
## Random Variables

A **random variable** X on a probability space is a total function whose domain is the sample space.

Since we are assuming the sample space $S$ is either finite or countable infinite, the range of a random
variable is either finite or countably infinite, and the outcomes where $X$ takes a given value can be viewed
as events written as
* ${\rm Pr}(X=k)$

Two random variables $R_1$ and $R_2$ are said to be independent provided these events are all independent, that is

$R_1$ and $R_2$ are said to be **independent random variables** by definition if forall $j$ and $k$ we have
* ${\rm Pr}[R_1=j]$ and ${\rm Pr}[R_2=k]$ are independent events

$$
{\rm Pr}[(R_1=j) \wedge (R_2=k)] = {\rm Pr}[R_1=j] * {\rm Pr}[R_2=k] 
$$

Making the assumption that two random variables are independent makes it easier to reason about them
because knowing the value of one variable doesn't impact the value of the other, that is

* ${\rm Pr}[(R_1=j) \ \vert \ (R_2=k)]$
* $= {\rm Pr}[(R_1=j) \wedge (R_2=k)]/{\rm Pr}[R_2=k]$  by definition of conditional probability
* $= {\rm Pr}[R_1=j] * {\rm Pr}[R_2=k] /{\rm Pr}[R_2=k]$ by definition of independence
* $=  {\rm Pr}[R_1=j]$ by algebra assuming ${\rm Pr}[R_2=k] \not - 0$

If we can reasonably believe that two variables are independent, it makes it much easier to reason about them.
