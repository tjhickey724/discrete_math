# Tutorial

In this section, we define a sequence $s$ will always be an infinite sequence of integers (or sometimes reals or complex numbers)

$s = s_0,s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n,\ldots$

These are important in Computer Science because we often measure the efficiency of a program by how it performs on inputs of length $n$.
If we let $s_n$ be that measure, for example an upper bound on the number of steps it takes or on the amount of memory it requires, then if we can calculate $s_n$ as a function of $n$ it will allows us to determine how efficient the program is.

We will look at 2 different kinds of sequences
* [polynomial sequences](polynomial_sequences.md) where $s_n=p(n)$ for some polynomial $p(x) = a_0 +a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \dots a_k x^k$
* [exponential sequences](exponential_sequences.md) where $s_n =a_0 b_0^n + a_1 b_1^n + \ldots a_k b_k^n$

## Example 1
Let $s_i$ be the sequence defined by $s_n = n^2 - 4n + 5$ for $n=0,1,2,\ldots$. Calculate the first 5 terms of $s$

**Answer:** $s_0 = 5$, $s_1= 1-4+5 = 2$, $s_2= 4-8+5 = 1$, $s_3 = 9-12+5 =2$, $s_4 = 16-16+5 = 5$

## Example 2
Let $s_n$ be the sequence defined by $s_n = 4*2^n + 3*(-1)^n$, calculate the first 4 terms of $s$.

**Answer:** $s_0 = 4*1 + 3 = 7$, $s_1 = 4 * 2 + 3 * -1 = 8-3=5$, $s_2 = 4*4 + 3 = 19$, $s_3 = 4*8 -3 = 29$.


We will learn how to recognize when a sequence is one of these two types, and how to find the coefficients $a_i$ (and mabybe $b_i$) when it is.

In practice, sequences which are polynomial corresponds to "practical" programs like sorting and database searching,
while sequence which are exponential are not feasible, like determining if a boolean formula is satisfiable.

Next, we will show how to use [induction](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/sequences/induction.md) to prove
that a closed form found using the previous techniques is correct for that sequence.

We give an introduction to how these techniques are useful in Computer Science by discussing the analysis of [AVL Trees](AVLapplication.md)
where the height of a tree in terms of how many nodes it has gives an estimate of how long it takes to do basic operations on that tree.

Finally, we will show how to use generating functions to prove that the techniques described above are correct (and hence you only
need to use induction to check your work!) Here is a [pdf on Generating Functions](GeneratingFunctions.pdf) which outlines the general approach.
The key idea is to use a series to define a function, and use the properties of the series (e.g. recursion equation) to determine properties of the
function. In many cases, the function turns out to be something simple and we can use our knowledge of that function to calculate a formula for the
elements of the series!
