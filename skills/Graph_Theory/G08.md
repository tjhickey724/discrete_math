## Labelled graphs
Sometimes we label the edges of a digraph.

## Finite State Machines aka Deterministic Finite Automata
A good example of a digraph is a finite state machine which is used to define "regular expressions" that can easily
be recognized by computer programs. We'll give some examples in class. The edges of a DFA are labelled with characters from some alphabet. One of the nodes is identified as the start state, and one or more nodes are final states. A string of characters
is accepted by the DFA if it can be generated by a character labels on a path starting at the start state and ending in a final state.

Here is an example of a DFA that will accept binary numbers with an even number of 1's.

**DFA Skill** - determine a DFA for some set of strings and/or determine if a string is accepted by a particular DFA

## Non-deterministic Finite Automata
We can create a more general finite state machine where allow multiple edges out of a node to have the same label.
Given an NFA with states S we can create a DFA whose states are a subset of P(S)
