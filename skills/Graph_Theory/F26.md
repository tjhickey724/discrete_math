# Sample-Problems

We will not be directly assessing your mastery of Binary Relations in this class,
but here are some problems about binary relations you can try if you're interested.

## Problem 1

In the graphs below there are several cycles.
* What is the fewest number of edges you would need to remove to eliminate all of the cycles?
* How many primitive cycles are there, i.e. cycles that don't contain other cycles?
* What is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes in the graph? What about the in-degrees? Why are they the same?

## Directed Graphs

A **directed graph (or digraph)** $G$ is a pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices or nodes, and $E$ is a subset of $V \times V$ called the edges of $G$.
We can draw a 2d visual representation of a graph by plotting each of the points $v$ of $V$ as distinct point $p(v)$ on the x-y plane and then
for each edge $(a,b)$ in $E$ draw a line between the points $p(a)$ and $p(b)$, usually with an arrow at the end point to $b$. 

We say that the the edge $d=(a,b)$ goes from $a$ to $b$,
* $a$ is the tail of $e$
* $b$ is the head of $b$

Here is an example of a digraph G=(V,E) of some Computer Science course numbers where the edges represent prerequisite relationships.

## Path and Cycles
A **path** in a digraph is a connected sequence of edges starting at a vertex $v$ and ending at a vertex $w$.
If $v=w$ then we say that the path is a **cycle**, that is, it is a path that ends at the same vertex it started at.

# Answers

## Problem 1

In the graphs below there are several cycles.
* What is the fewest number of edges you would need to remove to eliminate all of the cycles?
  _removing cb cc ge gf eliminates all cycles_
 
* How many primitive cycles are there, i.e. cycles that don't contain other cycles?
  _becb  bdecb ff fhgf fhgecf are all primitive cycles in this sense_

* What is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes in the graph? What about the in-degrees? Why are they the same?
 _the sum of out-degrees is 14, as is the sum of in-degrees, and both are equal to the number of edges as each edge
  contributes to one in-degree count and to one out-degree count_
