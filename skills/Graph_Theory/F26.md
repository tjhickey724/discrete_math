# Sample-Problems

We will not be directly assessing your mastery of Binary Relations in this class,
but here are some problems about binary relations you can try if you're interested.

## Problem 1

In the graphs below there are several cycles.
* What is the fewest number of edges you would need to remove to eliminate all of the cycles?
* How many primitive cycles are there, i.e. cycles that don't contain other cycles?
* What is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes in the graph? What about the in-degrees? Why are they the same?

## Directed Graphs

A **directed graph (or digraph)** $G$ is a pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices or nodes, and $E$ is a subset of $V \times V$ called the edges of $G$.
We can draw a 2d visual representation of a graph by plotting each of the points $v$ of $V$ as distinct point $p(v)$ on the x-y plane and then
for each edge $(a,b)$ in $E$ draw a line between the points $p(a)$ and $p(b)$, usually with an arrow at the end point to $b$. 

We say that the the edge $d=(a,b)$ goes from $a$ to $b$,
* $a$ is the tail of $e$
* $b$ is the head of $b$

Here is an example of a digraph G=(V,E) of some Computer Science course numbers where the edges represent prerequisite relationships.

| Vertices | Edges (prerequisites) | graph |

## Path and Cycles
A **path** in a digraph is a connected sequence of edges starting at a vertex $v$ and ending at a vertex $w$.
If $v=w$ then we say that the path is a **cycle**, that is, it is a path that ends at the same vertex it started at.

In the prerequisite digraph the longest path is (10a,12b,21a,150a) and there is at most one path between any two vertices.

This digraph doesn't contain any cycles.



# Representing Digraphs
The simplest way to represent a digraph is as a 2d table of integer values where
* the ith row and jth column contains $1$ if there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$
* otherwise there it contains $0$

This table is called the adjacency matrix. Here is the adjacency matrix for the CS prerequisite digraph.
|     |10a |12b |21a| 29a |121b|130a|131a|150a|
| --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| 10a |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |    |
| 12b |    |    |  1 |    |    |    |    |    |
| 21a |    |    |    |    | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
| 29a |    |    |    |    |    | 1  |    | 1  |
|121b |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|130a |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|131a |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|150a |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

where we assume there are zeroes in all of the blank entries.

For a very large matrix it is better to just have a list of adjacent vertices for each vertex.

| node|children|
| --- |---  |
| 10a |  12b |
| 12b |   21a |
| 21a | 121b 130a 131a 150a   | 
| 29a |  130a 150  |
|121b |    | 
|130a |    | 
|131a |    | 
|150a |    | 


# Paths in a digraph
It turns out that there is a nice way to calculate the number of paths between each pair of vertices using
the adjacency matrix.  Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix for a graph G with nodes $\\{1,2,\ldots,n\\}$, then
* the entry in A for the ith row and jth column is denoted $A_{ij}$
* this is the number of paths from $i$ to $j$ of length 1

To calculate the number of paths of length 2 between $i$ and $j$ we need to count the number of nodes $k$ for which
there is a path from $i$ to $k$ and from $k$ to $j$.  If we let $A^2$ be the matrix whose $ij$ th entry is the number of paths from $i$ to $j$ of length 2, then

$$(A^2)_{ij} = \sum_{k-1}^n A_{ik} * A_{kj}$$

$$(A^2)_{ij} = \sum_\limits{k=1}^s A_{ik}*A_{kj}$$

Notice that this will take $n^3$ multiplications to find all of $n^2$ entries in the matrix $A^2$.

and this is exactly the definition of the matrix multiplication of $A$ with itself!

## Matrix Multiplication
If $A$ is a rxs matrix and $B$ is a sxt matrix, then $A * B$ is the matrix $C$ whose entries are

$$C_{ij} = \sum_\limits{k=1}^s A_{ik}*B_{kj}$$



Visually we multiply the $i$ th row by the $k$ th column, by multiplying the corresponding elements (1st 2nd 3rd ..)
and summing those products. Here is an example:

```
1 1 0        1 0 0       2 1 0
0 0 1    *   1 1 0  =    1 1 1
1 0 0        1 1 1       1 0 0
```
For example, multiplying the 1st row of A by the 2nd column of B gives 

$(1 1 0) * (0 1 1) = 1 * 0 + 1 * 1 + 0 * 1 = 1$

## Reachability and Transitive Closure

We can use a similar approach if we want to find whether node i is reachable from node j.

If we defined the relation $a\prec b$ to mean b is reachable from a, then it is clear this
is a partial order (i.e. it is transitive), but it may not be a strict partial order. We
can compute this relation using a kind of matrix multiplication... 

The reachability relation for a partial order is called the transitive closure of that partial order. Given the adjacency matrix of a partial order, we would like to compute the adjacency
matrix of the transitive closure relatively quickly....

To do this, we can use an adjacency matrix with Boolean values, where 
* $A_{ij}=T$ if i=j or if there is an edge from i to j and
* $A_{ij}=F$ otherwise

To see if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ of length 2, we would use the following calculation

$$(A^2)_{ij} = \bigvee_\limits{k=1}^n A_{ik}\wedge A_{kj}$$

This is just matrix multiplication but using $\vee$ for addition and $\wedge$ for multiplication.

Calculating this boolean matrix requires about $n^3$ conjunctions and disjunctions.

Similarly, we can use the same approach to calculate $(A^2)^2=A^{2^2}$ which will take another $n^3$ steps

Continuing $k$ times we can calculate $B = A^{2^k}$ in $kn^3$ steps 
and this will be matrix where $B_{ij}=T$ if there is apath from $i$ to $j$ of length $2^k$ or less.

If the graph contains $n$ nodes, then if there is a path from $i$ to $j$, then there is a path with length
at most $n$ (Prove it!)

This implies that if we compute $B=A^{2^k}$ for $2^k\ge n$,
then $B_{ij}=T$ if and only if there is a path from $i$ to $j$ of any length.

Since $2^k\ge n$ if and only if $k \ge \log_2(n)$, this means we can compute the reachability matrix for the graph $G$
in time $n^3 \log_2(n)$ by repeatedly squaring the matrix $A$ $\log_2(n)$ times. This proves the

**Theorem.** The reachability matrix for a digraph with $n$ nodes can be computed in $n^3 \log_2(n)$ steps.

# Answers

## Problem 1

In the graphs below there are several cycles.
* What is the fewest number of edges you would need to remove to eliminate all of the cycles?
* 
  _removing cb cc ge gf eliminates all cycles in the abstract digraph,
    removing the edge from i++ to the test in the flow chart eliminates the only loop_
 
* How many primitive cycles are there, i.e. cycles that don't contain other cycles?
  _becb  bdecb ff fhgf fhgecf are all primitive cycles in this sense in the abstract digraph,
    the flow chart has just one cycle_

* What is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes in the graph? What about the in-degrees? Why are they the same?
 _the sum of out-degrees is 14, as is the sum of in-degrees, and both are equal to the number of edges as each edge
  contributes to one in-degree count and to one out-degree count_
