# Sample-Problems

We will not be directly assessing your mastery of Binary Relations in this class,
but here are some problems about binary relations you can try if you're interested.

## Problem 1
Let $f$ be a multi-valued partial functions from $A$ to $B$.
Let $f^{-1}:B \rightarrow A$ be the multi-valued partial function defined by 

$$f^{-1}(b) = a \leftrightarrow f(a)=b$$

where for any particular $b$ there may be many such $a$ so $f^{-1}$ might be multi-valued.

Show that
* $f$ is single-valued if and only if $f^{-1}$ is injective
* $f$ is total if an only if $f^{-1}$ is surjective
* $f$ is surjective if and only if $f^{-1}$ is total
* $f$ is injective if and only if $f^{-1}$ is single-valued

## Binary Relations

A **binary relation** is a subset $E$ of $A\times B$ for two sets $A$ and $B$ or equivalently a boolean function $R:A\\times B \rightarrow \mathbb{B}$.
When viewed as a boolean function we write
* $aRb \leftrightarrow (a,b)\in E \leftrightarrow R(a,b)=T$

Examples: 
* Let $\mathbb N$ be the natural numbers and let $R$ be the relation defined by $R(a,b) \leftrightarrow a\le b$
* Let $H$ be the set of all five card poker hands and let $R(h1,h2)$ be true if $h2$ is worth more than $h1$
* Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a partial function and define $R(a,b) \equiv  f(a)=b$, so every graph can be viewed as a relation




## Multi-valued Partial Functions
Another way to think about a relation is as
a *multi-valued partial function*, which is a function $f:A \rightarrow 2^B$ where $f(a)$ is the set of values that $f$ takes on $a$
which could be empty, could be a single value $b$ or could be set of values $\\{b)1,\ldots,b_n\\}$

For example, we can define $f_1:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow 2^\mathbb{R}$ by $f_1(x)$ is the set of real numbers such that $y^2=x$.
So $f_1(4)= \\{2,-2\\}$ and $f_1(0) = \\{0\\}$ and $f_1(-1) - \\{\\}$, we usually write this as $f_1(x) = \pm \sqrt{x}$.

Let $R$ be the relation defined by $R(x,y) \equiv x=y^2$ then $R$ can be viewed as the multivalued partial function $f_1(x) = \pm \sqrt{x}$

Any binary relation $R$ can be viewed as a multi-valued partial function $f$ and vice versa via
* $aRb \equiv b\in f_R(a)$ and
* $f_R(a) = \\{b: aRb\\}$
We sometime just write $R(a)$ instead of $f_R(a)$.

Let $f$ be a multi-valued partial functions from $A$ to $B$.
Then $f^{-1}:B \rightarrow A$ is the multi-valued partial function defined by

$$f^{-1}(b) = a \leftrightarrow f(a)=b$$

We can define the image and the inverse image of a set under a multi-valued partial function $f$ in the same way as for functions:
* $f(S)  = \\{b: \exists a \in S \ f(a)=b\\}$
* $f^{-1}(T) =\\{a: \exists b\in T\  f(a)=b\\}$

We can also compose multivalued partial functions. if $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B\rightarrow C$, then 
$$f(g(a)) = c \leftrightarrow \exists b\in B (g(a)=b)\wedge (f(b)=c)$$

Graphically, it is the set of all elements which can be reached by the following the arrows
from a node $a\in A$ to a node $c\in C$$.

If we let $M(A,B)$ be the space of multivalued functions from $A$ to $B$, then
$f \rightarrow f^{-1}$ is a 1-1 bijection  from $M(A,B)$ onto $M(B,A)$.
Further $M(A,B)$ = P(A\times B)$

## In and out degree
We can represent relations graphically by drawing arrows between elements $a$ of $A$ and $b$ of $B$ if $f(a)=b$.

The figure below shows four binary relations drawn in this way.

![binary relations](binary_relations.png)

* R1 is not a function, it is however a multi-valued partial function
* R2 is a bijection
* R3 is a surjective partial function
* R4 is an injective function

We can extend the notion of injectivity and surjectivity to Relations by looking at the number of edges leaving each node in A (the out degree)
and the number of edges going into a node in B,  the in degree.
* R is a function if the outdegree $\le 1$ for each $a\in A$
* R is a total function if the outdegree is $= 1$ for each $a\in A$
* R is injective if the indegree is $\le 1$ for each $b\in B$
* R is surjective if the outdegree is $\ge 1$ for each $b \in B$


## Partial Orders
A **partial order** is a binary relation $R$ on $A \times A$ for some set $A$, which satisfies the following property
* Transitivity: $\forall a \forall b \forall x \ aRb \wedge bRc \rightarrow aRc$

If it also satisfies the following axiom it is a **strict partial order**
* Irreflexivity $\forall a \neg (aRa)$
  
The canonical partial order is the less-than-or-equal-to relationship on integers $a\le b$
and the standard strict partial order is the less-than relation $a\lt b$.

We often use the symbol $\preceq$ for a partial order and $\prec$ for a strict partial order, so

* Transitivity: $\forall a \forall b \forall x \ a\preceq b \wedge b\preceq c \rightarrow a\preceq c$
* Irreflexivity $\forall a  (a\not\prec a)$

## Equivalence Relations
An **equivalence relation** is a binary relation $R$ on $A\times A$ which is
* reflexive; $\forall a \ aRa$
* symmetric: $\forall a \forall b \ aRb \rightarrow bRa$
* transitive: $\forall a \forall b \forall x \ aRb \wedge bRc \rightarrow aRc$

An equivalence relation partitions the set $A$ into equivalence classes consisting of
all of the elements which are equivalent to each other. We often use the symbol $\equiv$ for an equivalence relation, so it will satisfy
* reflexive; $\forall a \ a\equiv a$
* symmetric: $\forall a \forall b \  a\equiv b \rightarrow b\equiv a$
* transitive: $\forall a \forall b \forall x \ a\equiv b \wedge b\equiv c \rightarrow a\equiv c$

### Example
Let $A$ be the set of integers and let $aEb$ be true if 2 divides $a-b$.
The the equivalence classes are the even numbers and the odd numbers.


## Partitioning a set into equivalence classes

Given a partial order $\preceq$ we can define an equivalence relation $\equiv$ by
* $a\equiv b \leftrightarrow a\preceq b \wedge b\preceq a$

for example, the equivalence relation for $a\le b$ on the integers is just equality
* $a==b \ \equiv \ (a\le b) \wedge (b \le a)$

We can define a strict partial order from our original partial order by
* $a \prec b \ \leftrightarrow \  (a\preceq b) \wedge (a \not\equiv b)$

## Linear Orders
a partial order $\preceq$ is a linear order if 
* $\forall a \forall b a\preceq b\ \vee \ b\preceq a$

In many programming languages, the sorting methods ask you to pass in a linear order relation
to allow the elements to be sorted.

## Directed Graphs

A **directed graph (or digraph)** $G$ is a pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices or nodes, and $E$ is a subset of $V \times V$ called the edges of $G$.
We can draw a 2d visual representation of a graph by plotting each of the points $v$ of $V$ as distinct point $p(v)$ on the x-y plane and then
for each edge $(a,b)$ in $E$ draw a line between the points $p(a)$ and $p(b)$, usually with an arrow at the end point to $b$. 

We say that the the edge $d=(a,b)$ goes from $a$ to $b$,
* $a$ is the tail of $e$
* $b$ is the head of $b$

## Path and Cycles
A **path** in a digraph is a connected sequence of edges starting at a vertex $v$ and ending at a vertex $w$.
If $v=w$ then we say that the path is a **cycle**, that is, it is a path that ends at the same vertex it started at.

# Answers

## Problem 1
Let $f$ be a multi-valued partial functions from $A$ to $B$.
Let $f^{-1}:B \rightarrow A$ be the multi-valued partial function defined by 

$$f^{-1}(b) = a \leftrightarrow f(a)=b$$

where for any particular $b$ there may be many such $a$ so $f^{-1}$ might be multi-valued.

Show that
1. $f$ is single-valued if and only if $f^{-1}$ is injective
2. $f$ is total if an only if $f^{-1}$ is surjective
3. $f$ is surjective if and only if $f^{-1}$ is total
4. $f$ is injective if and only if $f^{-1}$ is single-valued

**Answer:**
For 1, let's prove it by contradiction. Suppose $f^{-1}$ was not injective,
then there exists two different values $b_1$ $b_2$ of $B$ with $f^{-1}(b_1)=a=f^{-1}(b_2)$
which means that $f(a)=b_1$ and $f(a)=b_2$ with $b_1\ne b_2$, fo $f$ is not single valued.
Conversely, suppose $f$ is not single-valued, then $f(a)=b_1$ and $f(a)=b_2$ for some $b_1\ne b_2$,
which implies that $f^{-1}(b_1) = f^{-1}(b_2$ so $f^{-1}$ is not injective.

For 2, these follows directly from the definitions. If $f$ is total iff for all $a\in A$, there is a $b\in B$ with $f(a)=b$ for some $b$ in $B$,  that is $f^{-1}(b) = a$ which means $f^{-1}$ is surjective.

For 3 and 4, these are corollaries of 1 and 2, because $f^{-1}$ is a multi-valued function.
