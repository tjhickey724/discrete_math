# Sample Problems

# Problem 1
Prove the following using a proof by contradiction.

**Theorem.** The cube root of 11 is irrational.

# Tutorial

To prove that $A \rightarrow B$, assume $A$ is true but $B$ is false and show this generates a contradication and hence can't be true.  Thus whenever $A$ is true, $B$ can't be false, so $B$ must also be true.

Let's use this to prove that $n^2$ is odd implies $n$ is odd.

**Proof:**
Suppose that $n^2$ is odd, but $n$ is not odd. Then $n$ must be even.
<br>
So $n=2k$ for some integer $k$, so $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 2(2k^2)$ is a multiple of 2 and hence is even.
<br>
This contradicts our premise that $n^2$ is odd, so $n$ can not be even, so it must be odd.
<br>
**QED**

## Interesting Application.
Let's use these techniques to prove something more interesting, that the square root of 2 is irrational, that is, can't be expressed as a fraction $a/b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers.

**Theorem**  $\sqrt{2}$ is an irrational number.

**Proof**
We will prove this by contradiction. Assume $\sqrt{2} = a/b$ for integers $a$ and $b$.

We know that we can remove any common factors of $a$ and $b$ to put the fraction in lowest terms (why??)

so we can assume that they are not both even (why?)

so $\sqrt{2}=a/b$ iff $2 = (a/b)^2$ iff $2=a^2/b^2$ iff $2b^2 = a^2$. So $a^2$ is even, and hence by our results above $a$ must be even.

Hence $a=2k$ for some integer $k$.

Thus $2b^2=a^2$ iff $2b^2=(2k)^2$ iff $2b^2 = 4k^2$ iff $b^2=2k^2$ by factoring 2 out of both sides.

So $b^2$ is even, hence by our results above $b$ must be even.

But we chose $a$, $b$ so that $a/b$ was in lowest terms and hence they can't both be divisible by $2$.

This contradiction shows that $\sqrt{2}$ can not be a rational number, hence it is irrational.

**QED**

# Problem 1
Prove the following using a proof by contradiction.

**Theorem.** The cube root of 11 is irrational.

You can assume that if $p$ is a prime and $p$ divide $n^k$ for integers $n,k>1$,
then $p$ divides $n$.

**Proof:** 

We will prove this by contradiction. Let's assume that the cube root of 11 is not irrational,
then there exists integers $m$ and $n$ such that $11^{1/3}=m/n$ and the fraction $m/n$ is in lowest terms,
that is $m$ and $n$ have no common factors.

Let's cube both sides of the equation so we get

$11 = m^3/n^3$

and multiplying both sides by $n^3$ we get

$11 n^3 = m^3$

which implies that 11 divides $m^3$ and so 11 must divide $m$.

So $m = 11k$ for some integer $k$ and this implies that

$11 n^3 = (11 k)^3$

so 

$n^3 = 11* 11 * k^3$

and so 11 divides $n^3$ and hence 11 divides $n$ and this shows that 11 divides $n$ and $m$
but we assumed that $n$ and $m$ had no common factors. 

This contradiction shows that the cube root of 11 can not be rational.
**Q.E.D.**
