# Sample Problems

## Problem 1
Prove the following with a direct proof.

**Theorem.** if $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares (e.g. $4=2^2$ and $9=3^2$) then so is $ab$ (e.g. $4*9=36=6^2$)


## Problem 2
Prove the following with a contrapositive proof.

**Theorem.** If $a+b$ is odd, then either $a$ or $b$ is odd.

## Direct Proofs
Lets consider the domain of integers (0,1,2,..., -1,-2,...).
A number is even if it is a multiple of 2, that is
* $\forall x ({\rm even}(x) \leftrightarrow \exists d (x = 2d))$

otherwise it is odd, that is $x=2d+1$ for some d, that is
* $\forall x ({\rm odd}(x) \leftrightarrow \exists d (x = 2d+1))$

Let's prove that if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even.

**Lemma 1:** if $n$ is even, then $n^2$ must be even.

**Proof:** 
<br>
if n is even then n=2k for some integer k, 
<br>
so $n^2=(2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$, 
<br> so it $n^2$ a multiple of 2,
<br> hence it is even. Q.E.D.

The Q.E.D. stands for _Quod Erat Demonstrandum_ which is Latin for "what was to be shown"
and is often found at the end of a proof signalling that the proof is over.

Let's have you give a direct proof of the following:
* if $x$ is odd, then so is $x^2$.
* if $x$ and $y$ are even, then so is $x+y$
* $x*y$ is even if $x$ is even

## Proof by Contrapositive
Suppose we want to prove the following:
* if $n^2$ is odd then $n$ must be odd

This has the form $A\rightarrow B$ where $A$ is $n^2$ is odd, and $B$ is $n is odd.

Since $A\rightarrow B$ is logically equivalent to its contrapositive $\neg B \rightarrow \neg A$.
We can prove that instead, i.e.
* if $n$ is not odd, then $n^2$ is not odd

Remembering that $n$ is not odd is the same as saying $n$ is even, we must then prove
* if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even

which we have already proved and which was fairly easy!

Let's have you prove the following:
* if $n^3$ is odd, then $n$ is odd
* if $n^3$ is even, then $n$ is even

## Proofs of iff statements
Often we want to prove that two logical statements are equivalent, e.g.
* $n^2$ is even if and only if $n$ is even

which has the form $A\leftrightarrow B$
* $A$ is $n^2$ is even, and
* $B$ is $n$ is even

To prove $A\leftrightarrow B$ there are a few ways to proceeed.
1. prove that $A\rightarrow B$ and $B\rightarrow A$
2. prove that $A\rightarrow B$ and $\neg A \rightarrow \neg B$, where we're proving the contrapositive of $B\rightarrow A$
3. find statements $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n$ and prove a chain of simpler iff's that starts with $A$ and ends with $B$
   * $A=A_1\leftrightarrow A_2\leftrightarrow\ldots\leftrightarrow A_n=B$


Let's try to use one of these methods to prove the following:

__Theorem.__  $n^2$ is even if and only if $n$ is even.

__Proof__.
First we prove that $n$ is even implies $n^2$ is even (which we have done above).
$n$ even means $n=2k$ for some integer $k$, so $n^2=(2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$ so $n^2$ is even.

Then we prove that if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even. This we prove by proving the contrapositive,
if $n$ is not even the $n^2$ is not even. So if $n$ is not even, then it is odd, so $n=2k+1$ for some integer k. Hence $n^2 = 4k^2 +4k+1 = 2(2k^2+2k) + 1 = 2j+1$ for some integer $j$, and so is odd by definition.

# Answers

## Problem 1
Prove the following with a direct proof.

**Theorem.** if $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares, then so is $ab$.

**Proof:** if $a$ and $b$ are perfect squares, then there are integers $j$ and $k$ with $a=j^2$ and $b=k^2$
So $ab= j^2 k^2 = jjkk = jkjk = (jk)^2$, so $ab$ is a perfect square.
**Q.E.D.**

## Problem 2
Prove the following with a contrapositive proof.

**Theorem.** If $a+b$ is odd, then either $a$ or $b$ is odd.

**Proof:**
The contrapositive is that if $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $ab$ is even.
So if $a$ and $b$ are even, then there are integers $j$ and $k$ such that
$a=2j$ and $b=2k$ and hence $a+b = 2j + 2k = 2(j+k)$ and so $a+b$ is even.
Since the contrapositive is true, the original theorem must also be true.
