# F17: Functions: Properties

The ability to categorize functions and prove properties of functions. In particular, 
* to show that a given function is (or is not) partial/total, injective, surjective, bijective 
* to prove properties of compositions and inverses of functions based on properties of the individual functions
* to show that two sets are isomorphic by defining a bijection between them


## Surjection, Injections, and Bijections
A function is **injective** or **one-one** if no two elements of $A$ get mapped to the same element of $B$, that is
* $\forall a_1 \forall a_2 (f(a_1)=f(a_2)) \rightarrow (a_1=a_2)$
We write injections with a hooked arrow:
* $f: A \hookrightarrow B$

A function is **surjective** or **onto** if for every $b$ in $B$ there is an $a$ in $A$ with $f(a)=b$.
* $\forall b\in B\ \exists a\in A \ \ (f(a)=b)$
We write surjections with a twohead arrow:
* $f: A \twoheadrightarrow B$

A function is **bijective** or **one-one and onto** if it is both injective and surjective. 
We also say such a function is a **one-to-one correspondence**  


## Product of functions
Let $f:A\rightarrow C$ and $g:B\rightarrow D$ be functions, then $f\times g:A\times B \rightarrow C\times D$ is the function defined by

$(f\times g)(a,b) = (f(a), g(b))$

# Problems
## Properties
Consider the following functions on the real numbers. 
For each function say if it is a total function or a partial function.
Also say if it is surjective or injective or both.
* $f(x)=x^2$  
* $g(x)=x^3$
* $h(x) = \sqrt{x}$


## Products
Let $j(x) = 2*x$ and $k(x)=x^2+1$, 
* what is the function $j\times k$?
* What is $g\circ(j\times k)$, where $g((x,y)) = x+y$ $g:N\times N \rightarrow N$?

### Proofs
Let $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B\rightarrow C$ be functions
* Prove that if $f\circ g$ is surjective, then $f$ must be surjective.
* Prove that if $g\circ f$ is injective, then $f$ must be injective.
* Prove that $(f\circ g)^{-1} = (g^{-1})\circ (f^{-1})$
* Prove that $f(f^{-1}(S)) = S$ for every $S\subset C$
