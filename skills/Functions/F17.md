# Skill Description

The ability to categorize functions and prove properties of functions. In particular, 
* to show that a given function is (or is not) partial/total, injective, surjective, bijective 
* to prove properties of compositions and inverses of functions based on properties of the individual functions
* to show that two sets are isomorphic by defining a bijection between them

---

# Sample Problems

For each of the following functions, state if it is:
* (T) total,
* (S) surjective (i.e. onto),or
* (I) injective (i.e. 1-1)

It can be all three or none or any subset of the three.
Give the answer and (briefly) explain why it does or doesn't have each of those properties.
## Problem 1
Let $f:\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}\rightarrow \\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$ be defined by:
$f(0)=b$, 
$f(2)=c$,
$f(3)=d$,
$f(4)=c$,
$f(5)=e$

Is $f$ total? surjective? injective? why or why not?


## Problem 2
Let $g:\\{0,2,4\\} \rightarrow \\{b,c\\}$ 
be the restriction of $f$ to $\\{0,2,4\\}$, that is
it takes the same values as $f$ on 0,2 and 4; so $g(0) = f(0) = b$, $g(2)=f(2) =c$, $g(4)=f(4) = c$.
    
Is $g$ total? surjective? injective? why or why not?
    
## Problem 3

Let $h$ be the restriction of $f$ to the odd numbers $h:\\{1,3,5\\}\rightarrow \\{d,e\\}$.
   
Is $h$ total? surjective? injective? why or why not?

## Surjection, Injections, and Bijections
A function is **injective** or **one-one** if no two elements of $A$ get mapped to the same element of $B$, that is
* $\forall a_1 \forall a_2 (f(a_1)=f(a_2)) \rightarrow (a_1=a_2)$
We write injections with a hooked arrow:
* $f: A \hookrightarrow B$

A function is **surjective** or **onto** if for every $b$ in $B$ there is an $a$ in $A$ with $f(a)=b$.
* $\forall b\in B\ \exists a\in A \ \ (f(a)=b)$
We write surjections with a twohead arrow:
* $f: A \twoheadrightarrow B$

A function is **bijective** or **one-one and onto** if it is both injective and surjective. 
We also say such a function is a **one-to-one correspondence**  


## Product of functions
Let $f:A\rightarrow C$ and $g:B\rightarrow D$ be functions, then $f\times g:A\times B \rightarrow C\times D$ is the function defined by

$(f\times g)(a,b) = (f(a), g(b))$

## Properties
Consider the following functions on the real numbers. 
For each function say if it is a total function or a partial function.
Also say if it is surjective or injective or both.
* $f(x)=x^2$  
* $g(x)=x^3$
* $h(x) = \sqrt{x}$


## Products
Let $j(x) = 2*x$ and $k(x)=x^2+1$, 
* what is the function $j\times k$?
* What is $g\circ(j\times k)$, where $g((x,y)) = x+y$ $g:N\times N \rightarrow N$?

### Proofs
Let $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B\rightarrow C$ be functions
* Prove that if $f\circ g$ is surjective, then $f$ must be surjective.
* Prove that if $g\circ f$ is injective, then $f$ must be injective.
* Prove that $(f\circ g)^{-1} = (g^{-1})\circ (f^{-1})$
* Prove that $f(f^{-1}(S)) = S$ for every $S\subset C$

# Answers

For each of the following functions, state if it is:
* (T) total,
* (S) surjective (i.e. onto),or
* (I) injective (i.e. 1-1)

It can be all three or none or any subset of the three.
Give the answer and (briefly) explain why it does or doesn't have each of those properties.

## Problem 1
Let $f:\\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}\rightarrow \\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$ be defined by:
$f(0)=b$, 
$f(2)=c$,
$f(3)=d$,
$f(4)=c$,
$f(5)=e$

Is $f$ total? surjective? injective? why or why not?

**Answer:**
* $f$ is not total as it isn't defined on "1".
* $f$ is not surjective as it doesn't map onto "a".
* $f$ isn't injective as it maps both 2 and 4 to "c".

## Problem 2
Let $g:\\{0,2,4\\} \rightarrow \\{b,c\\}$ 
be the restriction of $f$ to $\{0,2,4\}$, that is
it takes the same values as $f$ on 0,2 and 4; so $g(0) = f(0) = b$, $g(2)=f(2) =c$, $g(4)=f(4) = c$.
    
Is $g$ total? surjective? injective? why or why not?

**ANSWER:**
* $g$ is total as it is defined on on elements of the domain (0,2,4)
* $g$ is surjective as $g(0)=b$ and $g(2)=c$
* $g is not injective, as $g(2)==g(4)$
    
## Problem 3

Let $h$ be the restriction of $f$ to the odd numbers $h:\\{1,3,5\\}\rightarrow \\{d,e\\}$.
   
Is $h$ total? surjective? injective? why or why not?

**ANSWER:**
* $h$ is not total as it isn't defined on 1.
* $h$ is surjective  as it maps 3 to $d$ and 5 to $e$
* $h$ is injective as $h(3)\ne h(5)$
