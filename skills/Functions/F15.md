# F15: Functions: Functions: Syntax and Semantics

Ability to use and understand mathematical notation for functions. 
In particular, 
* to calculate values of compositions of given functions
* to compute the images and inverse images of a given function on subsets of the domain or codomain
* to work with function defined by cases, or by mathematical formulas, or both

A function $f$ is an associations of elements in one set $A$ called the **domain** of f 
to elements in another set $B$ called the **codomain** of f
and is written:

$f: A \rightarrow  B$

The element $b$ of $B$ that a function $f$ associates to an element $a$ of $A$ is denoted $f(a)$.

## Ways to define functions

Functions can be defined in many ways. For example,
1. By listing its values on domain elements, e.g. $f({\rm T})=1, f({\rm F})=0$
2. By giving an expression to evaluate $f(x) = x + (1/x)$
3. By explaining the association in words $f(n)$ is the $n$ th prime number, for natural numbers $n\gt 0$
4. By giving a menu style definition

$$
f(p)=
\left\\{
\begin{array}{ll}
p &\text{if }p\gt 0 \\ 
-p &\text{otherwise}.
\end{array} 
\right.
$$

A function is a **total function** if it assigns a value to every element of its domain, otherwise it is a **partial function**.

For example the function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is defined by 

$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$

then $f$ is not defined for negative
numbers $x$ and so is a partial function, but $g(x) = x^2$ is a total function.


## Functions on subsets of a domain
We also can use $f:A\rightarrow B$ to define a function on subsets of $A$ to subsets of $B$ by
* $f_*(S) \ = \ \\{f(x)| x \in S\\}$

So $f_*:2^{A} \rightarrow 2^B$

Since it is usually clear by context whether we are referring to $f$ or $f_* $, 
we usually drop the subscript and just write $f(S)$ for a subset $S$ of $A$ instead of $f_*(S)$.

We say that $f(S)$ is the **image** of $S$ under $f$, and if the domain of $f$ is $A$, then
we say that $f(A)$ is the **range** of $f$.

For example, if $f$ and $g$ are functions on $\mathbb{Z}$ defined by $f(x)=x+1$ and $g(x)=2x$,
and if $E$ is the set of even integers and $O$ is the set of odd integers, then
* $g(\mathbb{Z}) = E$
* $f(E)=O$ and $f(O)=E$

## Inverse images
Let $f:A\rightarrow B$ be a function, and $S\subseteq B$ a subset of $B$, then we define the
inverse image of $S$ under $f$ to be

$f^{-1}(S) = \\{a \in A :   f(a) \in S \\}$

Note that $f$ is a function from the powerset of $B$ to the powerset of $A$.

$f:2^{B}\rightarrow 2^{A}$


### Problems
Let $f(x)=2x+1$
* what is the range of the function $f$ defined on the integers ${\bf Z}$
* what is the range of $f$ on $\bf R$
* what is the image of the real interval $[2,4]$ under $f$?
* what is the inverse image of the real interval $[2,4]$ under $f$?

Let $g:\\{a,b,c,d\\} \rightarrow \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ be defined by

$g(a)=2$, $g(b)=1$ $g(c)=2$, $g(d)=4$

* what is $f(\\{a,b,c\\})$ ?
* what is $f^{-1}(\\{1,2,3\\})$ ?
