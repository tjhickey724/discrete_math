# F16: Functions: Composition
The ability to compute and reason about compositions of functions In particular, 
* to calculate the values of a function formed by composing functions on products, powersets, sums, etc.
* to calculate the image and inverse image of sets defined by compositions

## Composition of functions
If $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B \rightarrow C$ are functions, then their composition $f\circ g:A\rightarrow C$
is defined by first applying $g$ and then $f$:

$(f\circ g)(a) = f(g(a))$

That is it takes $a\in A$ and gets a $b=g(a)\in B$ and then applies $f$ to $b$ to get $c=f(b) =f(g(a))$.

$a \rightarrow g(a) \rightarrow f(g(a))$

For example, let
* $f(x) = x^2+2$
* $g(a,b) = a+b$

Then $g:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and the composition is 

$f(g(a,b)) = f(a+b) = (a+b)^2+2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 2$

# Problems
Let $h(x) = (x^2+1, 2x)$ be a function from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$. Calculate the following functions:
* $g\circ h$
* $h\circ f$
* $g \circ h \circ f$
