## Composition of functions
If $g:A\rightarrow B$ and $f:B \rightarrow C$ are functions, then their composition $f\circ g:A\rightarrow C$
is defined by first applying $g$ and then $f$:

$(f\circ g)(a) = f(g(a))$

That is it takes $a\in A$ and gets $b=g(a)\in B$ and then applies $f$ to $b$ to get $c=f(b) =f(g(a))$.

$a \rightarrow g(a) \rightarrow f(g(a))$

For example, let
* $f(x) = x^2+2$
* $g(a,b) = a+b$

Then $g:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and the composition is 

$f(g(a,b)) = f(a+b) = (a+b)^2+2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 2$

# Answers

## Problem 1
Let
* $f(x) = x^2+2$ be a function from ${\bf R}$ to ${\bf R}$
* $g(a,b) = a+b$ be a function from ${\bf R}^2$ to ${\bf R}$
* $h(x) = (x^2+1, 2x)$ be a function from ${\bf R}$ to ${\bf R}^2$.

Calculate the following functions:
* $g\circ h$

  **Answer:**  $g(h(x)) = g(x^2+1, 2x) = x^2+1+2x = (x+1)^2$

* $h\circ f$

  **Answer:** $h(f(x)) = h(x^2+2) = ((x^2+2)^2+1, 2(x^2+2))$

* $g \circ h \circ f$

  **Answer:** $g(h(f(x)) = g((x^2+2)^2+1, 2(x^2+2)) = (x^2+2)^2+1 + 2(x^2+2) = x^4 + 6x^2 + 9$
